This is version 2.6.0 of the JX source distribution.  To build it, simply
run gnu make ("make" or "gmake" on most systems) in a command line window
in the JX-2.6.0 directory and follow the instructions that are printed.

If you are new to the JX Application Framework, then it is important to
understand that it is not a program that you can run.  Rather, it is a set
of classes that provide a foundation on which you can build a program with
a graphical interface.  If you are familiar with either MicroSoft Visual
Studio or MetroWerks CodeWarrior, then the equivalent components are as
follows:

Please read the LICENSE file for the conditions under which the source is
provided.

The code has been thoroughly tested on Linux and Solaris.  Bizzare behavior
and crashes may be the result of broken system libraries.  We am willing to
work with you to solve such problems, so please don't hesitate to contact
us, but since we don't have access to your system, the burden of proof must
rest on you if a system call that works fine on all other systems doesn't
work for you.

To help reduce our email load, please always check the JX web site before
sending us a bug report because we might already know about it and have
posted a fix.  Suggestions are always welcome because they help us decide
what is most important, so we know what to implement next, but please check
the Bazaar Projects page first to check if somebody else is already working
on it.

The main web page for JX is:

It is also important to realize that we do not maintain ACE.  You are
welcome to contact us if you have problems compiling it, but the ACE
developers are more likely to be able to help, and patches should be sent
to them, not to us.  JX uses ACE because networking is horribly
UNIX-variant-dependent, and the ACE developers are much better at dealing
with this than we are.  The ACE web page is:
