<title> Running an arbitrary command </title>
</head>

The \"Run command\" dialog lets you run an arbitrary command without first having to open a terminal window.  You can also specify the directory in which to run the command.  The \"Run in shell\" and \"Run in window\" checkboxes correspond to the \"Shell\" and \"Window\" command types, respectively, in the <a href=jxhelp:JFSBindingEditorHelp>File Binding Editor</a> dialog.  If you turn off the \"Stay open\" checkbox, the dialog will close when you click the \"Run\" button.
