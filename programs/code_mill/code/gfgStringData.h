The dialog is resizable, and the position and size are remembered.\n\n<h3> Searching for text </h3>\n\nEnter the text for which to search in the \\\"Search for\\\" input area.  The right \\\"Find\\\"\nbutton searches for the next match and selects it, while the left \\\"Find\\\" button\nsearches for the previous match.\n<p>\nIf \\\"Ignore case\\\" is checked, the search will not be case-sensitive.\nIf \\\"Wrap search\\\" is checked, the search will wrap around if it hits the\nbeginning or end of the text and will continue from the end or the beginning,\nrespectively.  If \\\"Entire words only\\\" is checked and the search text is also\nentire words (e.g. \\\"hello\\\" or \\\"hi there\\\", but not \\\"this?\\\"), the search\nwill ignore matches that are part of other words.  As an example, \\\"and\\\" will\nnot match \\\"sand\\\".\n<p>\nIf \\\"Regex search (egrep)\\\" is checked, the search text will be interpreted as a\n<a href=jxhelp:JXRegexHelp>regular expression</a>.  The \\\"Ref\\\" button displays a\nshort reference summary of regula",
"r expression syntax.  If \\\"Treat as single line\\\"\nis checked, the regex will be allowed to match across multiple lines.  Otherwise,\neach match will only be allowed to extend until it reaches a newline character.\n<p>\nClicking on the down arrow next to the \\\"Search for\\\" input area displays a menu\nof the last 20 search patterns.  Selecting one copies it to the input area.\n<p>\nThe right \\\"Find\\\" button has the shortcuts Return and Meta-G.  The left \\\"Find\\\"\nbutton has the shortcuts Shift-Return and Meta-Shift-G.  The latter shortcuts are\nthe same as in the Text Editor window.\n\n<h3> Replacing text </h3>\n\nEnter the text with which to replace the currently selected match in the\n\\\"Replace with\\\" input area.  The \\\"Replace\\\" button replaces the selected text if it\nmatches the current search text.  The \\\"Replace & Find\\\" buttons do the same and\nthen search for and select the next or previous match.  If \\\"Wrap search\\\" is\nchecked, the \\\"Replace all\\\" buttons search for all matches in the specified direction\nstarting from the beginning or end of the text and replace each one.  Otherwise, they\nsearch for all matches starting from the current caret position or selection and\nreplace each one, stopping at the beginning or end of the text.\n<p>\nIf \\\"Regex replace\\\" is checked, the replace pattern will be interpreted as a\n<a href=jxhelp:JXRegexHelp#Replace>regular expression</a>.  Note that the shortcut\nfor toggling this checkbox is Meta-Shift-X, because Meta-X is the shortcut for\n\\\"Regex search.\\\"\n<p>\nIf \\\"Preserve case\\\" is checked, the case of the replace text will be adjusted to\nmatch that of the matched search text, when possible.  This is primarily useful\nwhen performing a case-insensitive search.  The rules for when the case is adjusted\nare as follows:\n\n<ol>\n<li> If the texts have the same length, the case of each character is adjusted\n     separately.  For example, matching \\\"aBc\\\" and replacing with \\\"xyz\\\" produces\n     ",
"\\\"xYz\\\".\n<p>\n<li> Otherwise, the first letter's case is adjusted, and then the rest of\n     the letters' cases are adjusted if all but the first letter in the matched\n     text have the same case.  For example, matching \\\"aBC\\\" and replacing with\n     \\\"wxyz\\\" produces \\\"wXYZ\\\", while matching \\\"AbC\\\" produces \\\"Wxyz\\\".\n</ol>\n\nClicking on the down arrow next to the \\\"Replace with\\\" input area displays a menu\nof the last 20 replace patterns.  Selecting one copies it to the input area.\n<p>\nThe \\\"Replace\\\" button has the shortcut Meta-=.  The right \\\"Replace & Find\\\"\nbutton has the shortcut Meta-L.  The left \\\"Replace & Find\\\" button has the\nshortcut Meta-Shift-L.  These are the same shortcuts as in the Text Editor window.\n\n<h3> Sharing search parameters between programs </h3>\n\nSince many programs allow you to search through text, this program has been designed to allow the search parameters to be automatically shared with other programs via the <a href=http://www.newplanetsoftware.com/xsearch/>XSearch protocol</a>.  The advantage of this is that you can use the \\\"Enter search string\\\" menu item in one program, the \\\"Enter replace string\\\" menu item in a second program, and then search and replace in a third program without ever having to use the clipboard to transfer any of the text.  All the other options in the Search Text dialog are also shared, so you can configure a search in one program and then use it in any other program that supports the protocol.\n\n</html>\"\nitsUseSmallButtonsCB::JXToolBarEditDir::JXLayout \"Use small buttons\"\nDOWNLOAD_URL \"http://newplanetsoftware.com/nps/downloads.php\"\nitsNextTipButton::JXTipOfTheDayDialog::JXLayout \"Next tip\"\nitsIgnoreCaseCB::JXSearchTextDialog::shortcuts::JXLayout \"#I\"\nAssertUnsavedFilePrefix::JXFileDocument \"##untitled##_\"\nCLASS_COPYRIGHT \"Copyright © $year by $author.

Once the dock is created, you can sub-divide it by right-clicking on the separator between the panes.\n<p>\nBy default, all panes expand and shrink equally when the window is resized.  By using the options for elasticity on the right-click menu for any pane separator, you can specify that only one pane in a group should expand or shrink.  Typically, this is the pane that contains the windows that you work with the most.\n<p>\nTo specify that a particular type of window should always be placed in a particular pane, dock a window of the desired type in that pane, right-click on the vertical bar to the left of the menu bar in the newly docked window, and select \\\"Automatically dock new windows of this type in this pane.\\\"\n<p>\nYou can create more than one dock.

Note that, since it is based on the ASCII table,\n	     <tt>[A-z]</tt> will match A through Z, [, \\\\, ], ^, _, `, and a through z.

The syntax is much simpler than for searching.  Every\ncharacter other than backslash (\\\\) and dollar ($) acts the same as before.\n\n<p>\n\nWhen a backslash is followed by one of the following characters, it is\ntranslated just like in the search pattern:\n\n<p>\n<tt>\\\\\\\\</tt> -> backslash <br>\n<tt>\\\\$</tt> -> dollar <br>\n<tt>\\\\t</tt> -> horizontal tab <br>\n<tt>\\\\n</tt> -> newline\n\n<p>\n\nWhen a dollar is followed by a positive integer N, this is converted into\nthe string that the Nth pair of parentheses in the search string matched.\n$0 represents the entir",
"e match, even if it was not enclosed in parentheses.\nAs an example:\n\n<blockquote>\n<dl>\n<dt> <tt>ab(c[ef])gh</tt>\n<dd> This can match <tt>abcegh</tt> and <tt>abcfgh</tt>.\n<p>\n<dt> <tt>wx$1yz</tt>\n<dd> This converts the above matches as follows:\n<p>\n		<tt>abcegh</tt> -> <tt>wxceyz</tt>\n<br>\n		<tt>abcfgh</tt> -> <tt>wxcfyz</tt>\n</dl>\n</blockquote>\n\nWhen a dollar is followed by a name in curly braces, this is converted into\nthe string that the named pair of parentheses in the search string matched.\nAs an example:\n\n<blockquote>\n<dl>\n<dt> <tt>ab(?P&lt;x&gt;c[ef])gh</tt>\n<dd> This can match <tt>abcegh</tt> and <tt>abcfgh</tt>.\n<p>\n<dt> <tt>wx${x}yz</tt>\n<dd> This converts the above matches as follows:\n<p>\n		<tt>abcegh</tt> -> <tt>wxceyz</tt>\n<br>\n		<tt>abcfgh</tt> -> <tt>wxcfyz</tt>\n</dl>\n</blockquote>\n\nWithout named parentheses, complicated regex's with nested parentheses can\nmake it very difficult to determine the correct value of N.  There are\ntwo features that alleviate this problem.\n\n<p>\n\nIf the opening parenthesis is followed by <tt>?:</tt>, then the contents\nare not counted when determining N.  As an example, if the regex is\n<tt>((?:red|white) (king|queen))</tt>, then the replacement pattern\n<tt>$2</tt> will produce \\\"king\\\" or \\\"queen\\\" rather than \\\"red\\\" or\n\\\"white.\\\"\n\n<p>\n\nFor the hackers out there, you can also use negative integers after a\ndollar.  $-1 is converted into the string that the <em>last</em> pair of\nparentheses in the search string matched, $-2 is converted into the string\nthat the next to last pair of parentheses in the search string matched,\netc. This can be useful if you want to count from the end of the string.\n\n<h3> For the experts... </h3>\n\nThe best book on the subject is:\n\n<blockquote>\n<cite><a href=http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/regex/desc.html>\nMastering Regular Expressions</a></cite>, by\n<a href=http://enterprise.ic.gc.ca/~jfriedl/regex/>Jeffrey Friedl</a>,\nO'Reilly, 1997.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe Perl ",
"and PCRE man pages are the final authority on how Code Crusader's regular\nexpressions behave.  Therein are described many features which are too\ncomplicated and/or obscure to be included here, e.g., lookahead and\nlookbehind assertions, conditional subpatterns, and subpattern recursion.\n\n<p>\n<b> Matching ambiguities </b> (the longest of the leftmost)\n<p>\n\nIt is easy to write a regular expression that can match a given string in\nmany ways at many positions.  The rule that avoids such ambiguities is that\nthe match that starts closest to the beginning of the string wins.  If more\nthan one match is possible at this position, the longest possible match\nwins, unless you explicitly use the <tt>?</tt> modifier to make a\nquantifier non-greedy.\n\n<p>\n<b> Operator precedence </b>\n<p>\n\nWhen more than one operator can apply to a subexpression, they are applied\nin the following order of precedence:\n\n<pre>\n    (highest precedence, applied first)\n\n    () [] ^ $ \\\\\n    * + ? {,}\n    catenation\n    |\n\n    (lowest precedence, applied last)\n</pre>\n\nAs an example, <tt>a|b*</tt> is equivalent to <tt>(a)|(b*)</tt> and matches a\nsingle <tt>a</tt> or any number of <tt>b</tt>'s rather than being equivalent to\n<tt>(a|b)*</tt> and matching any number of consecutive <tt>a</tt>'s and <tt>b</tt>'s.\n\n</html>\"\nEmptyComposeRuleList::JXHelpManager \"<html>\n<head><title> Special key sequences </title></head>\n<body> No special key sequences have been defined. </body>\n</html>\"\nitsChooseFileButton::JXPTPrintSetupDialog::shortcuts::JXLayout \"#O\"\nitsCloseButton::JXSearchTextDialog::shortcuts::JXLayout \"#W^[\"\nsaveButton::JXSaveFileDialog::shortcuts::JXLayout \"^M\"\nobj5_JXLayout::GFGMainDirector::JXLayout \"Copyright:\"\nMoveDescription::JXTEBase \"move the text\"\nUnreadable::JXPathInput \"This directory is unreadable.\"\nitsScrollCaretCB::JXMacWinPrefsDialog::JXLayout \"Caret follows when you scroll\"\nTriedWriteSaveNewFile::JXFileDocument \"Unable to obtain permission to write to the file.
