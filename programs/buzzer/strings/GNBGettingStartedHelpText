<h3>GettingStarted with the Buzzer Electronic Notebook</h3>

The Buzzer Electronic Notebook was written to keep track of 
lots of little pieces of information in one location. It consists of a 
hierarchy of notes and to-do list items all organized into groups. 

<p>

To get started, simply start adding notes, to-do list items and groups 
as desired, by using the menu items or the buttons on the button bar.
