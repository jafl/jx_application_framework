<h3>Working with you window manager</h3>
<a name=WM>

Window managers like fvwm2 and fvwm95 that provide a taskbar listing all 
the currently open windows allow you to filter this list based on the 
window's title or WM_CLASS attribute. The Buzzer Electronic Notebook 
sets WM_CLASS as follows: 

<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt> Main notebook window
<dd> Buzzer_Notebook
<p>
<dt> Trash window
<dd> Buzzer_Trash
<p>
<dt> Note window
<dd> Buzzer_Editor
</dl>
</blockquote>
