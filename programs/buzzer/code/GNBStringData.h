You can also place a caret after the first colon\nto negate the class, e.g., <tt>[:^digit:]</tt>.\n\n<p>\n<font size=-1>\nParaphrased from the <a href=http://pcre.sourceforge.net/>PCRE</a> man page and <cite><a href=http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/regex/desc.html>\nMastering Regular Expressions</a></cite>, by\n<a href=http://enterprise.ic.gc.ca/~jfriedl/regex/>Jeffrey Friedl</a>,\nO'Reilly, 1997\n</font>\n\n<a name=Replace>\n\n<h3> Regular Expression Replacement </h3>\n\nWhen you check the \\\"Regex replace\\\" checkbox in the Search Text window,\nyou get more flexibility for specifying how to perform replacement after a\nsuccessful search.  The syntax is much simpler than for searching.  Every\ncharacter other than backslash (\\\\) and dollar ($) acts the same as before.\n\n<p>\n\nWhen a backslash is followed by one of the following characters, it is\ntranslated just like in the search pattern:\n\n<p>\n<tt>\\\\\\\\</tt> -> backslash <br>\n<tt>\\\\$</tt> -> dollar <br>\n<tt>\\\\t</tt> -> horizontal tab <br>\n<tt>\\\\n</tt> -> newline\n\n<p>\n\nWhen a dollar is followed by a positive integer N, this is converted into\nthe string that the Nth pair of parentheses in the search string matched.\n$0 represents the entire match, even if it was not enclosed in parentheses.\nAs an example:\n\n<blockquote>\n<dl>\n<dt> <tt>ab(c[ef])gh</tt>\n<dd> This can match <tt>abcegh</tt> and <tt>abcfgh</tt>.\n<p>\n<dt> <tt>wx$1yz</tt>\n<dd> This converts the above matches as follows:\n<p>\n		<tt>abcegh</tt> -> <tt>wxceyz</tt>\n<br>\n		<tt>abcfgh</tt> -> <tt>wxcfyz</tt>\n</dl>\n</blockquote>\n\nWhen a dollar is followed by a name in curly braces, this is converted into\nthe string that the named pair of parentheses in the search string matched.\nAs an example:\n\n<blockquote>\n<dl>\n<dt> <tt>ab(?P&lt;x&gt;c[ef])gh</tt>\n<dd> This can match <tt>abcegh</tt> a",
"nd <tt>abcfgh</tt>.\n<p>\n<dt> <tt>wx${x}yz</tt>\n<dd> This converts the above matches as follows:\n<p>\n		<tt>abcegh</tt> -> <tt>wxceyz</tt>\n<br>\n		<tt>abcfgh</tt> -> <tt>wxcfyz</tt>\n</dl>\n</blockquote>\n\nWithout named parentheses, complicated regex's with nested parentheses can\nmake it very difficult to determine the correct value of N.  There are\ntwo features that alleviate this problem.\n\n<p>\n\nIf the opening parenthesis is followed by <tt>?:</tt>, then the contents\nare not counted when determining N.  As an example, if the regex is\n<tt>((?:red|white) (king|queen))</tt>, then the replacement pattern\n<tt>$2</tt> will produce \\\"king\\\" or \\\"queen\\\" rather than \\\"red\\\" or\n\\\"white.\\\"\n\n<p>\n\nFor the hackers out there, you can also use negative integers after a\ndollar.  $-1 is converted into the string that the <em>last</em> pair of\nparentheses in the search string matched, $-2 is converted into the string\nthat the next to last pair of parentheses in the search string matched,\netc. This can be useful if you want to count from the end of the string.\n\n<h3> For the experts... </h3>\n\nThe best book on the subject is:\n\n<blockquote>\n<cite><a href=http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/regex/desc.html>\nMastering Regular Expressions</a></cite>, by\n<a href=http://enterprise.ic.gc.ca/~jfriedl/regex/>Jeffrey Friedl</a>,\nO'Reilly, 1997.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe Perl and PCRE man pages are the final authority on how Code Crusader's regular\nexpressions behave.  Therein are described many features which are too\ncomplicated and/or obscure to be included here, e.g., lookahead and\nlookbehind assertions, conditional subpatterns, and subpattern recursion.\n\n<p>\n<b> Matching ambiguities </b> (the longest of the leftmost)\n<p>\n\nIt is easy to write a regular expression that can match a given string in\nmany ways at many positions.  The rule that avoids such ambiguities is that\nthe match that starts closest to the beginning of the string wins.  If more\nthan one match is possible at this po",
"sition, the longest possible match\nwins, unless you explicitly use the <tt>?</tt> modifier to make a\nquantifier non-greedy.\n\n<p>\n<b> Operator precedence </b>\n<p>\n\nWhen more than one operator can apply to a subexpression, they are applied\nin the following order of precedence:\n\n<pre>\n    (highest precedence, applied first)\n\n    () [] ^ $ \\\\\n    * + ? {,}\n    catenation\n    |\n\n    (lowest precedence, applied last)\n</pre>\n\nAs an example, <tt>a|b*</tt> is equivalent to <tt>(a)|(b*)</tt> and matches a\nsingle <tt>a</tt> or any number of <tt>b</tt>'s rather than being equivalent to\n<tt>(a|b)*</tt> and matching any number of consecutive <tt>a</tt>'s and <tt>b</tt>'s.\n\n</html>\"\nopenButton::JXChooseFileDialog::JXLayout \"Open\"\nitsReplaceIsRegexCB::JXSearchTextDialog::JXLayout \"Regex replace\"\nStatusSuccess::jProcessUtil \"Program finished successfully\"\nobj3_JXLayout::JXSpellCheckerDialog::JXLayout \"Suggestions:\"\nUnknownFileType::JImage \"\\\"$name\\\" either does not contain an image or uses an supported format.\"\ntext::JXFixLenPGDirector::JXLayout \"\"\nobj1_JXLayout::JXSearchTextDialog::JXLayout \"Search for:\"\nWindowWillNotFit::JXDockWidget \"This docking area is too small for the window.

The \\\"Replace\\\" button replaces the selected text if it\nmatches the current search text.  The \\\"Replace & Find\\\" buttons do the same and\nthen search for and select the next or previous match.  If \\\"Wrap search\\\" is\nchecked, the \\\"Replace all\\\" buttons search for all matches in the specified direction\nstarting from the beginning or end of the text and replace each one.  Otherwise, they\nsearch for all matches starting from the current caret position or selection and\nreplace each one, stopping at the beginning or end of the text.\n<p>\nIf \\\"Regex replace\\\" is checked, the rep",
"lace pattern will be interpreted as a\n<a href=jxhelp:JXRegexHelp#Replace>regular expression</a>.  Note that the shortcut\nfor toggling this checkbox is Meta-Shift-X, because Meta-X is the shortcut for\n\\\"Regex search.\\\"\n<p>\nIf \\\"Preserve case\\\" is checked, the case of the replace text will be adjusted to\nmatch that of the matched search text, when possible.  This is primarily useful\nwhen performing a case-insensitive search.  The rules for when the case is adjusted\nare as follows:\n\n<ol>\n<li> If the texts have the same length, the case of each character is adjusted\n     separately.  For example, matching \\\"aBc\\\" and replacing with \\\"xyz\\\" produces\n     \\\"xYz\\\".\n<p>\n<li> Otherwise, the first letter's case is adjusted, and then the rest of\n     the letters' cases are adjusted if all but the first letter in the matched\n     text have the same case.  For example, matching \\\"aBC\\\" and replacing with\n     \\\"wxyz\\\" produces \\\"wXYZ\\\", while matching \\\"AbC\\\" produces \\\"Wxyz\\\".\n</ol>\n\nClicking on the down arrow next to the \\\"Replace with\\\" input area displays a menu\nof the last 20 replace patterns.  Selecting one copies it to the input area.\n<p>\nThe \\\"Replace\\\" button has the shortcut Meta-=.  The right \\\"Replace & Find\\\"\nbutton has the shortcut Meta-L.  The left \\\"Replace & Find\\\" button has the\nshortcut Meta-Shift-L.  These are the same shortcuts as in the Text Editor window.\n\n<h3> Sharing search parameters between programs </h3>\n\nSince many programs allow you to search through text, this program has been designed to allow the search parameters to be automatically shared with other programs via the <a href=http://www.newplanetsoftware.com/xsearch/>XSearch protocol</a>.  The advantage of this is that you can use the \\\"Enter search string\\\" menu item in one program, the \\\"Enter replace string\\\" menu item in a second program, and then search and replace in a third program without ever having to use the clipboard to transfer an",
"y of the text.  All the other options in the Search Text dialog are also shared, so you can configure a search in one program and then use it in any other program that supports the protocol.\n\n</html>\"\nOverwriteChangedFilePrompt::JXFileDocument \"The copy of \\\"$name\\\" on disk has been modified by another program.
