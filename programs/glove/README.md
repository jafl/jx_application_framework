Installing
==========

The easiest way to install from the binary package is to run `sudo ./install`

Otherwise, the program (glove) should be placed in a directory that is on your execution path.  `/usr/bin` or `~/bin` are usually good choices.  Copy the libraries in `lib/` to a directory on your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.


Requirements
============

On MacOS, this program requires XQuartz, the X11 server.  Before running this program, you must first start XQuartz.

You also need to `brew install ace icu4c pcre gd`.


Notes
=====

Glove was designed as a flexible tool to address a number of issues. We needed a generic plotting tool, an interface to data acquisition systems, sophisticated (and correct) statistical analysis, and the ability to easily and intuitively manipulate the data we had.  The on-line help explains all the features of the program.
