Installing Glove:

The easiest way to install is to run:  sudo ./install

Otherwise, the program (glove) needs to be placed in a directory that is on
your execution path.  /usr/bin or ~/bin are usually good choices.  Copy the
libraries in lib/ to a directory on your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.


Running Glove:

If Glove crashes or if you find other bugs, please check the web
page first to see if they have already been reported.

On OS X, this program requires XQuartz, the X11 server.  Before running
this program, you must first start XQuartz.


Notes on Glove:

Glove was designed as a flexible tool to address a number of issues. We
needed a generic plotting tool, an interface to data acquisition systems,
sophisticated (and correct) statistical analysis, and the ability to easily
and intuitively manipulate the data we had.
