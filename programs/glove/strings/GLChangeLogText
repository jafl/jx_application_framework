<p>
The fitting code has been completely rewritten from the ground up. It is
much more robust and much quicker. It has also been expanded with the use
of dynamically loadable fitting modules that implement only the fit
function (an example module is included in the fitmodule directory). In
addition, a new graphical fit window has been added to simplify the fit
process.

Plots can now be printed to EPS files for easier inclusion in documents.

The online help is now searchable.
