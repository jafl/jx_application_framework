<h2><a name="GLTableHelp">Data Window</a></h2>

<p>The main window in Glove is a table which contains columns of numbers.
From this table, you can manipulate the data in many ways.</p>

<h3><a name="GLTableHelp-Data">Manipulating data</a></h3>

<h4>Editing a cell</h4>

<p>To edit a cell, double-click on it with the mouse. If it is already 
selected you can edit it by hitting the return key. To accept the 
changes to the cell, you can either hit return, shift-return, tab, 
or shift-tab, or click the "Ok" button in the top 
left corner of the table. If you hit the return key, the changes will be 
accepted and the cell below the current one will then be in edit mode. 
Shift-return will accept the changes and begin editing on the cell above 
the current one. Tab and shift-tab will accept the changes and shift 
editing to the cell the the right/left of the current one. 
To cancel the changes you made, hit the escape key. 
All changes made can be undone/redone by selecting "Undo/Redo"
from the "Edit" menu.</p>

<h4>Inserting, deleting, and duplicating</h4>

<p>You can insert, delete or duplicate rows, columns, or ranges of cells 
by selecting the appropriate cells by click-dragging the mouse and 
choosing "Insert", "Delete", or "Duplicate" from the 
"Edit" menu. Rows or columns can be selected by clicking on the 
row or column header number corresonding the the desired row or column. 
To extend the selection, you can either shift-left-click or right-click. 
The selection can be cleared by hitting the Escape key. 
All changes made can be undone/redone by selecting "Undo/Redo" 
from the "Edit" menu.</p>

<h4>Cutting, copying, and pasting</h4>

<p>After selecting a group of cells, you can cut or copy them by selecting 
"Cut" or "Copy" from the "Edit" menu. 
After cutting or copying the desired cells, you can paste them in 
in a few ways. If you have no cells selected when you paste, the pasted 
cells will be placed in a new column appended to the table. 
If you have a group of columns selected, the pasted cells will be placed 
in columns inserted before the selected columns. 
If you copied a single cell, you can select the destination cell and paste 
over it, thereby changing its value. If you copied a range of cells 
all contained within a single column, you can replace the same sized range 
of cells elsewhere, or insert them into a column by selecting the cell 
before which the pasted cells will be inserted. 
All changes made can be undone/redone by selecting "Undo/Redo" 
from the "Edit" menu.</p>

<h4>Generating and transforming data</h4>

<p>Glove can generate a sequence of numbers for you with the 
"Generate column by range" and "Generate column by increment" 
menu items in the "Data" menu. The resultant column of numbers can 
either be appended to the table, or can replace a current column. 
This or any other column of numbers can then be transformed with 
the transform dialog which is found in the "Data" menu.</p>

<h3><a name="GLTableHelp-Files">Working with files</a></h3>

<h4>Loading files</h4>

<p>To start a new file, select "New" from the "File" menu. 
To open an existing file, select "Open" from the "File" menu. 
If the file is a Glove file, it will open immediately. If not, a dialog 
box will pop up asking which <a href=jxhelp:GLModuleHelp>module</a> to use 
to open it. If the file is a delimited text file, select 
"Text (delimited)" from the menu. You will then be presented 
with a delimiter dialog box in which you can specify how the file is 
delimited.</p>

<h4>Saving files</h4>

<p>To save a file, select "Save" from the "File" menu. To save a file 
under a different name, select "Save as..." from the "File" menu. 
If you wish to save the file in a non-Glove format, use the desired 
<a href=jxhelp:GLModuleHelp>module</a> from the "Export modules..." 
menu.</p>

<h3><a name="GLTableHelp-Print">Printing and plotting data</a></h3>

<h4>Printing</h4>

<p>To print, select "Print..." from the "File" menu. 
Select "Print setup" from the "File" menu to specify whether 
to print in landscape or portrait mode. In the print dialog box, you 
can choose whether to print to a file or to a printer.</p>

<h4>Plotting data</h4>

<p>To plot columns of data, select "Plot data..." from the 
"Data" menu. The plot dialog will ask which columns 
represent x, y and the errors in x and y if desired. Use the 
"Plot" menu in the dialog to specify which plot to add this 
curve to. By default, a new plot is created. If you have columns selected, 
they will by default specify the x and y axis and the errors in the y and x 
axis respectively. </p>

<p>To plot a vector field, select "Plot vector field..." from the 
"Data" menu. If you have columns selected, they will by default 
specify the x and y axis and dx and dy.</p>


<hr>
<h2><a name="GLPlotHelp">Plot Window</a></h2>

<h3><a name="GLPlotHelp-Settings">Curve settings</a></h3>

<p>To change the settings of a curve, either select "Change curve
options..." from the Options menu, double-click on the appropriate curve
label in the legend, or right-click on the curve name in the legend.</p>

<h4>Scale</h4>

<p>You can change the scale of the plot in several ways. To view the scale
dialog box, which allows you to change the scale in both axes, you can
select "Change scale..." from the "Options" menu, or double-click
on the appropriate axis. To scale without the dialog, click and drag the
mouse, which will create a zoom rectangle. If the Meta key is pressed, the
scale will be changed to show exactly the region contained by the zoom
rectangle. If the Meta key is not pressed, a reasonable scale will be
chosen around the area of interest. To return the scale to the default,
select "Reset scale" from the "Options" menu.</p>

<h4>Range</h4>

<p>The range specifies what portion of the curves will be drawn, and what
portion of the curves will by used in the analysis. To set the range, zoom
in to the desired range and select "Copy scale to range" from the
"Options" menu. Alternately, you can specify a range in the "Edit
Plot Range" dialog by selecting "Change range..." from the
"Options" menu. You can then reset the scale by selecting "Reset scale"
from the "Options" menu.</p>

<h4>Labels</h4>

<p>You can edit the plot labels either by selecting "Change labels..." from the
"Options" menu or by double-clicking on the appropriate label.</p>

<h3><a name="GLPlotHelp-Cursors">Cursors</a></h3>

<p>Cursors are a useful way of determining the position of various features 
on a curve. If you view Dual cursors, the values of both cursors will be 
displayed along with the distance between them. To move a cursor, click and drag it.
For fine adjustments, click and then use appropriate the arrow keys.</p>

<p>The values of the cursors can be used by an external module, for example to
look up a value in an external table, by selected the appropriate module in
the "Cursor module" sub-menu of the "Cursor" menu.</p>

<h3><a name="GLPlotHelp-Marks">Marks</a></h3>

<p>You can mark a particular value with a line, either vertical or horizontal,
by selecting "Mark cursor" from the "Cursor" menu. If you select
"Show mark window", a table of the current marks will be displayed at
the bottom of the plot. This table can be printed to an encapsulated
postscript (EPS) file by selecting "Print marks as EPS..." from the
"Plot" menu.</p>

<h3><a name="GLPlotHelp-Analysis">Curve fitting</a></h3>

<p>To open the <a href=jxhelp:GLFitHelp>Fit window</a>, in order to fit a
curve, select "Open fit window" from the Analysis menu. Once fits have
been calculated from the fit window, the fit parameters and residual plots
can be viewed by selecting the appropriate entry in the "Fit
parameters" and "Residual plots" sub-menus.</p>


<hr>
<h2><a name="GLFitHelp">Fit Window</a></h2>

<p>The fit window consists of a number of subwindows. On the left side, the
available curves and fits are listed. After a fit is selected, its
functional form is displayed in the bottom left corner of the window, and
its parameters are listed in the upper right of the window. For some
functional forms, like polynomial, the fit can be done with no input from
the user. To fit this type of curve, either double click on the fit name
itself (in the fit list), or select "Fit" from the "Fit" menu.</p>

<p>Other functional forms require a first guess to be supplied by the user.
These guesses are typed into the "Fit values" input fields beside the
appropriate "Parameter name". When a value for each paramter has been
input, the values of the parameters can be tested by selecting "Test
start values" from the "Fit" menu. A curve corresponding to the
current parameters will then be drawn in the plot. Further changes made to
the "Fit values" will automatically be reflected in the test curve.
Once a reasonable approximation to the data is attained, select "Fit"
from the "Fit" menu.</p>

<p>Once a good fit has been obtained, it can be plotted on the original plot
by selecting "Plot" from the "Fit" menu.</p>

<h3><a name="GLFitHelp-AddingFits">Adding fits</a></h3>

<p>There are a number of ways to add new fit functions. A polynomial fit can
be added by selecting "New polynomial fit" from the "Fit" menu. A
non-linear fit can be added by selecting "New non-linear fit" from the
"Fit" menu. </p>

<p>For increased performance, a new fit function can be added by creating a
new fit module. An example of such a module can be found in the
"fitmodule" directory of the distribution. Once a module is created,
it should be placed in the user's home directory, in the
<code>~/.glove/fitdfmodule/</code> directory. It will then be displayed (after
restarting Glove), in the "Fit" list.</p>


<hr>
<h2><a name="GLModuleHelp">Modules</a></h2>

<p>Modules are intended to provide extended functionality to Glove at the 
user's control. The protocols are very simple, and involve reading and 
writing to standard in/out. Since Glove handles this through pipes, the 
modules may be written in any language.</p>

<p>Below is an enum containing relevant values for the modules:</p>

<pre>
enum 
{
// File import/export module values
	kGloveDataError = 0,
	kGloveMatrixDataFormat = 1,
	kGloveRaggedDataFormat = 2,

// General module values
	kGloveOK = 3,
	kGloveFail = 4,
	kGloveFinished = 5,

// Data module values
	kGloveRequiresData = 6,
	kGloveRequiresNoData = 7,
	kGloveDataDump = 8,
	kGloveDataControl = 9,

// Fit module values
	kGloveXY = 10,
	kGloveXYdY = 11,
	kGloveXYdX = 12,
	kGloveXYdYdX = 13
};
</pre>

<h3>Import modules</h3>

<p>Import modules should be placed in the importmodule directory of one of 
your module directories (by default <code>/usr/local/lib/glove</code>
and <code>~/.glove</code>).</p>

<p>The module is called with the name of the file to be imported as the argument. 
The module then verifies that the file is in the appropriate format. If it 
is not, the module prints the value <code>kGloveDataError</code>. If the file is in the 
proper format for the module, it prints <code>kGloveMatrixDataFormat</code> if the file 
is in a matrix format, i.e., all columns have the same number of rows. It 
prints <code>kGloveRaggedDataFormat</code> for ragged format. For matrix format, the 
module then prints the column count, followed by the data given row by row,
i.e., c1r1, c2r1, c3r1, c4r1, c1r2, &hellip;. For ragged format, the module then 
prints the column count, followed by the data column by column. Before 
each column, the number of rows in that column are printed.</p>

<h3>Export modules</h3>

<p>Export modules should be placed in the exportmodule directory of one of 
your module directories (by default <code>/usr/local/lib/glove</code>
and <code>~/.glove</code>).</p>

<p>The module is called with the name of the file to be exported as the argument. 
The module then prints the format that it desires, either matrix 
(<code>kGloveMatrixDataFormat</code>) or ragged (<code>kGloveRaggedDataFormat</code>).
For matrix format, Glove will then write the column count, the row count, and the data 
given row by row, i.e., c1r1, c2r1, c3r1, c4r1, c1r2, &hellip;. For ragged 
format, Glove will write out the column count data column by column. Before 
each column, the number of rows in that column are written.</p>

<h3>Data modules</h3>

<p>Data modules should be placed in the datamodule directory of one of 
your module directories (by default <code>/usr/local/lib/glove</code>
and <code>~/.glove</code>).</p>

<p>Data modules serve two purposes. For transformations that require more than 
a basic equation, a data module can be used to transform an arbitrary number 
of columns in an arbitrary way. A data module can also act as an acquisition 
module, serving as an interface to data acquisition hardware.</p>

<p>The module should begin by indicating whether or not it requires data. This 
is done by printing either <code>kGloveRequiresData</code> or
<code>kGloveRequiresNoData</code>. If 
the module requires data, it will then print the number of columns that it 
requires. Glove will then write out the number of rows, and the values 
given row by row. </p>

<p>The module now prints whether it will just be printing all of the data 
row by row with <code>kGloveDataDump</code>, or printing individual values, specified 
by row, column, and value, with <code>kGloveDataControl</code>. The module then prints 
the number of columns of data it will be printing.</p>

<p>The module is now ready to print the data. Each line of data is preceded 
by either <code>kGloveFinished</code>, <code>kGloveOK</code>,
or <code>kGloveFail</code>. If the module is using 
<code>kGloveDataDump</code>, then the module should then print all of the current row's 
values. If the module is using <code>kGloveDataControl</code>, it should print the row, 
column, and value of its data. When the module is finished, it should 
print <code>kGloveFinished</code>.</p>

<h3>Cursor modules</h3>

<p>Cursor modules should be placed in the cursormodule directory of one of 
your module directories (by default <code>/usr/local/lib/glove</code>
and <code>~/.glove</code>).</p>

<p>After the module process is started, Glove passes three booleans (T/F), 
<code>XCursorVisible()</code>, <code>YCursorVisible()</code>,
and <code>DualCursorsVisible()</code>. It will then 
write the valid values in the order x1, x2, y1, y2. If dual cursors are not 
on, for example, neither x2 or y2 will be written.</p>

<p>The module must now indicate if there was an error. It prints a line 
containing either <code>kGloveOK</code>, or <code>kGloveFail</code> followed
immediately by an error 
string. Once this line is printed, the cursor module simply prints whatever 
information it wants to print, which will be appended to the session.</p>

<h3>Fit modules</h3>

<p>Fit modules should be placed in the fitmodule directory of one of 
your module directories (by default <code>/usr/local/lib/glove</code>
and <code>~/.glove</code>).</p>

<p>After starting the module process, Glove must send the data to be fit to 
the module. Before the data is sent, Glove writes the type from, 
<code>kGloveXYdYdX</code>, <code>kGloveXYdX</code>, <code>kGloveXYdY</code>,
and <code>kGloveXY</code>. This is followed by the 
number of data points in the data set to be fit. Then Glove send the data 
in order x, y, dy, dx, but only if it is appropriate. For example, if there 
are no x errors, the data will be sent x, y, dy only.</p>

<p>The module must now indicate if there was an error. It prints a line 
containing either <code>kGloveOK</code>, or <code>kGloveFail</code>
followed immediately by an error 
string. Once this line is printed, the module prints the number of 
parameters, whether or not it has errors (T/F) and whether or not it has a 
goodness of fit value, all in one line. The module then prints the 
individual parameter's name and value, each on a single line.</p>
