e. <u>Other Licenses Available</u>.

<p>
<b>6. Limited Remedy</b>
<p>
If you receive media which is not free from defects in materials and workmanship during the stated warranty period, Licensor's entire liability and your exclusive remedy shall be, at Licensor's sole option, if you timely return the Software to Licensor either (a) repair or replace the defective media as soon as practicable, or (a) return of the price paid.

LICENSOR'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR OTHERWISE WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE OR OTHERWISE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF THE LICENSE FEE PAID BY YOU FOR THE SOFTWARE.  BECAUSE SOME STATES/COUNTRIES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
