Important note

The directory containing makemake must be on your execution path in order
for makemake to work correctly.

Changes from previous versions
*****

3.3.0

Adds output file to .cvsignore.

3.2.1

To reduce Makefile size, ignores dependencies on ace/* and *StdInc.h.

3.2.0

Added --make-name option so a make binary other than the one with which
makemake was built can be invoked.

Command to build program no longer filters out .a and .so files from
dependency list.

Automatically converts between .so and .dylib, based on the current OS.

"all" target is now double colon.

3.1.0

Added code to touch target to automatically run maketouch in each directory
listed in the TOUCHPATHS variable.

3.0.2

No longer complains if there are no files to parse for dependencies because
there never are unless you are using C/C++.

3.0.1

Added --assume-autogen option.  If an included file cannot be found, and it
was included with "...", then makemake assumes that this file will be
generated during the build and placed in the including file's directory.
(If this doesn't happen, you would get an error anyway, so no harm done.)

3.0.0

All targets specified in Make.files are now defined as double colon, so
additional commands can be executed in Make.header before the target is
actually built.

Java targets are now compiled with a single call to ${JAVAC} to avoid link
errors.

Added JPATH for specifying argument to -classpath.  If a .jar file is
listed as one of the files for a target, this will automatically be added
to -classpath.

Added --define to allow prepending make code before Make.header.  This is
primarily for defining variables to allow reuse of generic Make.header
files.

Added --search-path for specifying an additional directory to search for
the input files.  This option can be used multiple times, in which case the
directories are searched in the order listed on the command line.  The
current directory (.) is always searched first.

Added option to place part of Make.header after targets generated by
makemake.

Added MM_ALL_TARGETS to provide list of all the targets from Make.files.

Renamed --bin_dir to --obj-dir since it controls the location of
intermediate object files, not final binaries.

Renamed --no_std_inc to --no-std-inc for consistency.

If the target ends with .so, the link option required to produce a shared
library is automatically included.  It should no longer be included in
LDFLAGS.

Added option --suffix-map to allow specification of the suffix of the
output file produced when compiling a source file with a particular suffix.

Added option --no-parse to avoid parsing particular source file types for
dependencies.

The suffix of the output file can be specified by placing it between the
source file suffix and the file name.  As an example, ".java .class
MyClass" tells makemake that MyClass.class will be generated from
MyClass.java.  Note that it is not usually necessary to specify this level
of detail because makemake is quite good at guessing correctly.

Fixed bug so .jar files are no longer parsed.

Fixed bug so clean, etc. use directory specified by --obj-dir.

If makemake hangs, check the FAQ on the web for ways around this.

2.9.0

Added option --no_std_inc to exclude dependencies on files in /usr/include.
This makes the resulting Makefile more portable.

2.8.0

touch target is now a double colon target so you can invoke "${MAKE}
TOUCHSTRING=${TOUCHSTRING} touch" in other directories.  This eliminates
the need for TOUCHHEADERS.

2.7.2

Added option --check to only rebuild output file if input files are newer.

Renamed option -c to --choose to avoid confusion with --check.

2.7.1

No longer generates a link command for Java programs.

2.7.0

Added --bin_dir option to allow placing .o files in a separate directory.
The argument for this option is the name of the make variable that contains
the directory in which to place the .o files.  This is primarily useful
when coupled with the method described at
http://www.newplanetsoftware.com/jcc/multi_version.html.

2.6.0

Recognizes .jar suffix and automatically invokes ${JAR}.  (You must define
the variable JAR in Make.header.  It is usually "jar".)

Fixed bug so it uses .class instead of .o for .java files.

Uses temp file to avoid overflowing command line buffer.

2.5.0

Now recognizes Java (.java) and Eiffel (.e) files.

2.4.0

Now recognizes .so as well as .a library files.

2.3.0

Adds the ability to specify arbitrary dependencies by prefixing the line
with "literal: ".  The rest of the text on the line is appended verbatim to
the dependency line, ignoring the current prefix and suffix.  This is most
useful when the text is the evaluation of a variable.

2.2.0

Adds the tidy target to delete only the .o files.  clean and tidy are now
both double colon targets so you can extend them via extra code in
Make.header.  In addition, both of these targets now use the make variable
${RM}, so they no longer generate error messages if some of the files do
not exist.

2.1.0

makedepend is no longer used, so one no longer has to specify the full path
of each source file.  Profiling shows that this runs just as fast as the
old version that used makedepend, even though the new version uses dynamic
allocation.  Dynamic allocation allows it to avoid makedepend's hard limits
on the number of dependencies.

makemake
*****

When compared with the scriptable, integrated development environments
available on other platforms, UNIX make is a painful mess.  makemake was
written to alleviate some of the pain by generating a Makefile from a list
of source files.

More specifically, given the two files Make.header and Make.files, makemake
parses the files specified in Make.files to calculate their dependency
lists and then generates a Makefile compatible with GNU's version of make.

Make.header is simply copied to become the first part of the Makefile.  It
should contain all the variable definitions and special targets.  (makemake
automatically generates the targets all, tidy (double colon), clean (double
colon), checksyntax (see makecheck below), touch (see maketouch below), and
jdepend (internal use only).)  In particular, LINKER must be defined to be
the name of the program to use during linking, and DEPENDFLAGS must be set
to contain all the compiler directives so that jdepend will work correctly.
(LINKER is usually just the same as the name of the compiler, but it needs
to be mcc in order to use Mathematica's MathLink package.)

Here is a simple example of a Make.header file:

    # Useful directories

    MYCODEDIR := .

    # Directories to search for header files

    SEARCHDIRS := -I- -I${MYCODEDIR}

    # makemake variables

    LINKER       := gcc
    DEPENDFLAGS  := -g -Wall -Werror ${SEARCHDIRS}

    # make variables

    CC       := gcc
    CXX      := g++
    CCC      := g++
    CPPFLAGS  = ${DEPENDFLAGS}

If you include a line "### makemake inserts here ###" somewhere in
Make.header, then the targets that makemake generates will be inserted
there instead of being appended at the end.

Make.files contains a simple list of all the files required to build each
target as follows:

    @<name of first target>
    <first object file>
    <second object file>
    ...
    @<name of second target>
    ...

The object files should not contain a suffix, because makemake appends the
appropriate suffixes automatically.  (e.g. .c, .cc, .o, etc.)  The source
file suffix is .c by default, but can be set with the -suffix option.  The
current suffix can be overridden by placing the desired suffix in front of
the source name as follows:

    -suffix .cc
    @myprog
    .c myprog
    JString

The first line sets the default suffix to .cc.  The next line specifies the
name of the make target.  The third line tells makemake that the object
file myprog.o is required in order to build myprog, and that the source
file is called myprog.c.  The last line tells makemake that the object file
JString.o is also required in order to build myprog, and that the source
file is called JString.cc.

You can also specify the suffix for the output file by including it between
the source suffix and the file name:

    @myprog
    .java .class myprog

Note that this is not usually necessary since makemake is reasonably
intelligent about guessing the correct output suffix.

makemake correctly calculates dependencies for lex, flex, yacc, and bison
files.  Simply specify the .l or .y suffix.  Dependencies on libraries can
be included by specifying the .a or .so suffix.  (make is not powerful
enough to handle .so.<vers>, so create a symbolic link to get a pure .so
file.)  Libraries must also be listed separately in the standard make
variable LOADLIBES so the linker will pick the correct type.  Dependencies
on precompiled files can also be included by specifying the .o suffix.
This is useful if some files have to be compiled in a completely different
way, e.g. using a different Makefile. makemake recognizes .a, .so, .o,
.class, and .jar as special suffixes and does not try to calculate their
dependencies.  You can specify additional suffixes that should not be
parsed with the --no-parse command line option.

The -prefix option sets the prefix of all subsequent source files.  This is
useful if a group of files is in a different directory from the Makefile.
For convenience, the prefix is cleared when a new target is encountered.
As usual, comments can be included in Make.files by starting the line with
a hash (#).

If no objects files are listed for a target, it is assumed that they are
the same as those for the next target in the file.  This is especially
convenient for building several different versions of the same library.
(e.g. static .a and shared .so versions)

The command line options for makemake are as follows:

  -h                prints help
  -hf               <header file name>  - default Make.header
  -if               <project file name> - default Make.files
  -of               <output file name>  - default Makefile
  --obj-dir         <variable name>     - specifies directory for all .o files
  --no-std-inc      exclude dependencies on files in /usr/include
  --assume-autogen  assume unfound "..." files reside in includer's directory
  --check           only rebuild output file if input files are newer
  --choose          interactively choose the targets
  --make-name       <make binary> - name of GNU make binary

The following options can be used multiple times:

  --define      <code> - make code to prepend to Make.header
  --search-path <path> - add to paths to search after . for input files
  --suffix-map  .x.y   - file.y results from compiling file.x
  --no-parse    .x.y.z - specifies suffixes of files which should not be parsed

The --choose option prints a list of the targets found in Make.files, and
lets you choose which ones to include in the final Makefile.  Another way
to specify a particular subset of targets is to include their names after
the other options.

As mentioned above, your own special targets should be included in
Make.header.  Some targets (e.g. TAGS used for the etags program) require a
list of all the source files.  makemake provides this in the variable
called MM_ALL_SOURCES.  Thus, to define the TAGS target, simply include the
following in your Make.header:

    .PHONY : TAGS
    TAGS: ${MM_ALL_SOURCES}
        etags ${MM_ALL_SOURCES}

makecheck
*****

Sometimes it is helpful to be able to check a single source file after
modifying it.  This provides instant feedback on typos and such.  Of
course, one would prefer not to have to run make and wait while other files
are recompiled first.  This can be done by running make directly, but one
has to include the path exactly the way it is specified in the Makefile.
makecheck was written to solve this problem.  Once the Makefile is built,
simply type "makecheck MyClass.cc" to recompile only MyClass.cc.  makecheck
finds the correct path for you.

*****
maketouch
*****

Sometimes it is necessary to use compile-time flags to include or exclude
certain pieces of code.  (One should obviously try to minimize the need for
this, but NDEBUG, which turns off assert(), will always be there.)  In such
cases, one would prefer not to have to recompile everything (i.e. make
clean) when a flag that only affects a few source files is changed.
maketouch was written to alleviate this problem.  It works in conjunction
with makemake's special touch target to insure that only the files that use
the flag are actually recompiled.

Since makemake does most of the work automatically, maketouch is very easy
to use.  Simply type "maketouch compile_flag" to touch all the source and
header files that include "compile_flag".  If the program depends on
libraries that use the same "compile_flag", simply add the paths to each
library's Makefile to the TOUCHPATHS variable.  makemake will automatically
run maketouch in each of these directories.  If you need to do anything
more complicated, you can define extra code for the touch target in
Make.header as follows:

    .PHONY : touch
    touch::
        <your code here>
