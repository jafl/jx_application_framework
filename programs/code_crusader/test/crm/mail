I have been trying to configure JCC for
use with HPUX 10.20 w/ aCC compiler.  But I am
having problems with the build.  Do you know of anyone that has
config/makefiles for this platform?  I have read the release notes for ACE
on using HPUX with patches.  Any help would be great.

                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Thanks

Peter Gross <pgross@signalsoftcorp.com> built a config file for Sun CC
(which is probably pretty close, closer than g++), but he hasn't sent it to
me yet.  You could send him email asking him to send you his config file
(and also reminding him to send it to me).

That is a pretty strange error message, since it's just the base class
constructor.  Try changing line 62 of JOrderedSet.h from "private" to
"public" and let me know if that works.
