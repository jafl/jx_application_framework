You can switch to Macintosh-style menu shortcuts in the Miscellaneous Preferences dialog.

<div>

You can search for a symbol in Code Crusader's database from any Editor window via any of the following methods:

<ul>
<li> Hold down the Meta key and double-click on the symbol.
<li> Select the symbol and press F12.
<li> Right-click on the symbol and select \"Find as symbol\" from the menu.
</ul>

If the symbol is not found in Code Crusader's database, the UNIX man pages will automatically be searched, too.

<div>

Meta-double-click activates when the mouse is released, so you can select more than a single word.  This is useful for symbols like \"<tt>std::ios</tt>\".

<div>

You can open a file or URL from any Editor window vi any of the following methods:

<ul>
<li> Hold down the Control key and double-click on the file name or URL.
<li> Right-click on the file name or URL and select \"Open as file name or URL\" from the menu.
</ul>

Code Crusader will look in all directories that have been entered in the Search Paths dialog and also in <tt>/usr/include</tt>.

<div>

Clicking the middle mouse button in an Editor window pastes the current contents of the clipboard.

<div>

Holding down the partial word modifier key (adjustable in the Preferences dialog) makes the left and right arrows move the caret by one <em>partial</em> word at a time. As an example, this lets you move around inside both <tt>GetFileName</tt> and <tt>get_file_name</tt>.

<div>

If automatic indentation is turned on, Shift-Return maintains the current indentation but ignores the line prefix.

<div>

If you have configured Code Crusader to insert spaces when the Tab key is pressed, you can delete one space at a time by holding down the Shift key and then pressing the Backspace or Delete keys.

<div>

If you type a path and file name in the input field next to the file icon at the bottom of any Editor window and then press Return, Code Crusader will save the file to the entered location.
<p>
If you hold down the Control key when you press Return, Code Crusader will rename the file.  (If you are using Windows shortcuts, hold down the Meta key instead.)
<p>
If the path that you enter does not exist, Code Crusader will create it for you.

<div>

If you edit a file's name in the Project window and then hold down the Control key when you press Return, Code Crusader will rename the file.  (If the file is managed by a known Version Control System, it will be used to perform the rename.)

<div>

If you type a file name in the input field next to the file icon at the bottom of any Editor window and then drag the file icon to an XDS-enabled file manager, Code Crusader will save the file where you drop it.

<div>

If you double-click the file icon at the bottom of any Editor window, Code Crusader will invoke the \"Shell command to view file in file manager\" command.  This command is editable via the \"File manager & web browser...\" item on the Preferences menu.

<div>

If you hold down the Control key when you press Return in the Line input field, Code Crusader will only count hard line breaks instead of soft line breaks from word wrapping.  (If you are using Windows shortcuts, hold down the Meta key instead.)

<div>

If you hold down the Shift key when you press Return in the Line input field, Code Crusader will shift focus to the Column input field.

<div>

Any command that you need to run often should be added to the Commands menu.  You can enter a keyboard shortcut for the command, too.

<div>

If you specify a name for a command on the Commands menu, then you can invoke it from other commands via the &amp; prefix.
<p>
For example:  <tt>make a.out ; &my_command_1 ; make b.out ; &my_command_2</tt>.

<div>

Code Crusader's editor can be extended by writing scripts in your favorite language.  The selected text, if any, is passed to the script via <tt>stdin</tt>.  Output from the script, if any, is pasted into the Editor window.
<p>
In the Edit File Types dialog, set the script path for each appropriate file type and place your scripts (or symlinks to them) in the specified directory.  These scripts will then appear on the Scripts sub-menu when you right-click in an Editor window of the appropriate type.
<p>
Personal directories are inside <tt>~/.jxcb/scripts/</tt>.  System-wide directories are inside <tt>/usr/lib/jxcb/scripts/</tt>.

<div>

You can place a bookmark in any window by holding down the Meta key and clicking on the scrollbar thumb.
<p>
Additional options are available if you right-click on the scrollbar thumb.

<div>

You can jump to a bookmark by pressing:

<ul>
<li> Meta-1 through Meta-9 if you are using Windows-style shortcuts.
<li> Ctrl-1 through Ctrl-9 if you are using Macintosh-style shortcuts.
</ul>

The shortcut style is Windows by default, and can be changed in the Miscellaneous Preferences dialog.

<div>

Holding down the Shift key while clicking any scrollbar arrow scrolls by half a page at a time.

The same is true for the Page Up and Page Down keys.

<div>

Double clicking a <em>file</em> in the Save File dialog copies the name to the input field. This is useful if you want to replace a file or create a new file with a similar name.

<div>

Right-click on the docktab in the upper-left corner of any window to get a menu of docking options, including creating a new dock.

<div>

Right-click on the separator between docking areas to get menu of options, including sub-dividing compartments.

<div>

Right-click on the tabs in a docking area to change the placement of the tabs:  top, left, bottom, or right.

<div>

To dock a window, click the docktab in the upper-left corner of any window and then drag it to a docking area.

<div>

If you are not using a dock, position each type of window where you want it on your screen and then select \"Save window size as default\" from the Preferences menu in each window.

<div>

The Tasks menu operates on the active project.  If you have more than one project open at a time, you can activate a project by holding down the Meta key when you select a project from the Windows menu.

<div>

If you want to open a project via the \"Recent projects\" menu, but you do not want to reopen all the files that were open last time, hold down the Shift key while selecting the project from the menu.

<div>

If you hold down the Meta key when you select a project from the \"Recent projects\" menu, all windows will be closed before the selected project is opened.

<div>

Project templates provide a quick way to create new, pre-configured projects.  A project template can contain commands, build configuration, and source files.
<p>
This is very convenient for teachers who want to help their students focus on programming rather than configuration!

<div>

You can change the menu shortcuts by following the instructions in the <tt>menu_strings</tt> file that was included in the Code Crusader package.
