<h3> 6.4.1 </h3>

Fixed Ruby styler to recognize ? or ! at end of function name.
<p>
Fixed \"Treat as single line\" in Search Text dialog so <code>.</code> matches newlines.
<p>
Fixed Diff Output windows to maintain word wrap configuration from the source window.

<h3> 6.4 </h3>

Added syntax hilighting for Ruby.
<p>
Updated PHP completer to use function list from PHP 5.5.

<h3> 6.3.1 </h3>

Fixed HTML styler to understand CDATA and to recognize PHP and JSP code inside non-JavaScript script blocks.

<h3> 6.3 </h3>

Added support for terminal styling commands in Command Output and Compiler Output windows.
<p>
Added support for styling Mustache commands in HTML.
<p>
Fixed bug that sometimes caused \"Program Output\" windows to think that a process was running even after everything finished.
<p>
Fixed \"Compare files\" dialog to correctly display directory diffs for Subversion and Git when revisions are specified.
<p>
Fixed \"hungry delete\" to only eat a complete tabstop, so deleting space inside prose will always only delete one space at a time.

<h3> 6.2 </h3>

Added auto-detection of indenting style:  spaces or tabs.  If the file contains a mix, whitespace is made visible so you can clean it up.
<p>
Rudimentary support for <a href=jxhelp:CBEditorHelp#Emulators>vi emulation</a>.  You can turn it on in Editor Preferences dialog.
<p>
Line index input in Editor windows accepts $ as shortcut for \"last line.\"
<p>
Styling for Java annotations.  (What took me so long?)
<p>
Fixed crash when requesting version control diff for deleted file.
<p>
Fixed bug in \"Replace all forward\" when using \"Entire word only,\" so it replaces all occurrences instead of only the first one.

<h3> 6.1.2 </h3>

Support for automatic closing of HTML and JSP tags.  See the <code>html-auto-close</code> script included in the package.
<p>
Added command line option <code>--reopen</code>.
<p>
<code>jcc --search</code> now works even if Code Crusader is not already running.
<p>
Preserves ownership of text files and preferences file if you run as root.

<h3> 6.1.1 </h3>

Work around for strange X11 behavior that could cause Code Crusader to hang when run for the first time.

<h3> 6.1 </h3>

<b> Major changes </b>

<p>
Graphical diff for Git.  Also added command line option <code>--git-diff</code>.
<p>
Enhanced File Types dialog to allow file name patterns, e.g., <code>core.*</code>, in addition to file suffixes.
<p>
Anti-alised text.
<p>
Added support for Linux Large File System (LFS).
<p>

<b> <a href=jxhelp:CBProjectHelp> Project </a> </b>

<p>
Fixed Config button in Project window to search for <code>pom.xml</code> (Maven) and <code>build.xml</code> (ant) if no Makefile is found.
<p>
When a program crashes, Code Crusader tries to find the core file and print the location so you can Ctrl-double-click to open it with Code Medic.
<p>

<b> <a href=jxhelp:CBEditorHelp> Text Editor </a> </b>

<p>
Added \"Clean all ws &amp; alignment\" and \"Clean selected ws &amp; align\" to Edit menu.  \"Clean all whitespace\" and \"Clean selected ws\" no longer adjust alignment.
<p>
Fixed C#, Java, JavaScript, and PHP stylers to correctly style <code>/**/</code>.
<p>

<b> Miscellaneous </b>

<p>
Fixed window placement issues on OS X.
<p>
Fixed bug in \"Print with styles...\" so Print button is enabled.
<p>

<h3> 6.0.2 </h3>

<p>
Fixed crash when closing project without first closing the Compiler Output window.
<p>
Fixed crash when quitting with multiple Compiler Output windows open.
<p>

<h3> 6.0.1 </h3>

<p>
Removed Ctrl-Tab shortcut from Config button in Project window.  Ctrl-Tab is now the shortcut for switching between source and header files, regardless of the menu shortcut style set in the Miscellaneous Preferences dialog.
<p>
Fixed rare but very annoying crash during tab completion introduced in version 6.0.
<p>
Fixed bug so empty, invisible Program Output windows are closed when a task finishes.
<p>

<h3> 6.0 </h3>

<b> Major changes </b>

<p>
Thanks to ctags 5.8, added support for Adobe Flash, BlitzBasic, PureBasic, and FreeBasic, Java enums, and Matlab.  (requires ctags 5.8.0-2)
<p>
Added syntax highlighting and keyword completion for JSP pages.
<p>
Symbol table and inheritance trees are updated in the background.  (Finally!)
<p>
Added spell checking and whitespace cleaning options to Edit menu.  (Finally!)
<p>
Updated graphical Subversion diff to work with Subversion 1.4, 1.5, and 1.6.  Also added options in the dialog window to compare with the tip of trunk, any branch, or any tag.
<p>
Added command line options <code>--cvs-diff</code> and <code>--svn-diff</code>.
<p>
Window docking finally works with all window managers.
<p>

<b> <a href=jxhelp:CBProjectHelp> Project </a> </b>

<p>
Compile output recognizes errors printed by Maven builds.
<p>
If you rename a file that is under version control, Code Crusader will attempt to invoke the appropriate version control command to rename the file.
<p>
Finally connected project and editor windows:  If you rename a file (via Ctrl-Return in the file name display at the bottom) in the Editor window, all open projects that contain that file will be updated.
<p>
Symbol database is now updated after the build process is finished, since the build process may generate files that need to be parsed.
<p>
Symbol database is updated after any version control operation.
<p>
Tasks that do not open an output window now report errors in an alert window.
<p>
Project files open faster.
<p>
Added command line option <code>--no-reopen</code> to speed opening projects over a slow network connection.
<p>
Fixed bug that caused crash when closing a project while Symbol Search Results windows were open.
<p>
Displays confirmation dialog when removing files from a project.  This is a cop-out, since undo is the right way to handle this, but in my defense, removing files is an uncommon operation, and undo is very time consuming to implement.
<p>
Fixed Compiler Output window so Tasks menu is always for the project that was compiled, not for the active project.
<p>
Fixed bug so it no longer creates <code>.cvsignore</code> in directories managed by git.
<p>
Fixed bug which caused symlinks to be reparsed every time a project was opened.
<p>

<b> <a href=jxhelp:CBEditorHelp> Text Editor </a> </b>

<p>
Added \"Previous search/compile result\" and \"Next search/compile result\" to Search menu.  (Finally!)  This allows scanning through the active search or compile results without having to return to the Search Results or Compiler Output window.  The active Search Results or Compiler Output window is highlighted on the Windows menu.
<p>
Improved <a href=jxhelp:CBMacroHelp>character actions</a> to support automatic closing of XML tags.  See the <code>xml-auto-close</code> script included in the package.
<p>
Created <code>clean_indentation</code> script for XML files.
<p>
Implemented \"hungry delete\" so Backspace and Delete eat whitespace to the next tab stop when the \"Tab inserts spaces\" option is turned on.  If the option is not turned on, the Shift key turns on \"hungry delete.\"  If the option is on, the Shift key turns off \"hungry delete.\"
<p>
Added \"Clean all whitespace\" and \"Clean selection\" to Edit menu.  Based on the \"tab inserts spaces\" preference, this cleans the indentation of each line and strips trailing whitespace.
<p>
Added \"Tab inserts spaces\" option to Settings menu.
<p>
Added support for vi and emacs embedded configuration options:  tab-width &amp; indent-tabs-mode for emacs and tabstop &amp; autoindent for vi.
<p>
If you rename a file that is under version control (Ctrl-Return in the file name input area), Code Crusader will attempt to invoke the appropriate version control command to rename the file.
<p>
Ctrl-Return in Line input field computes the location based only on hard line breaks, not soft line breaks from word wrapping.  (If you are using Windows-style shortcuts, Meta-Return gives this behavior.)
<p>
Updated Bourne Shell syntax highlighting to recognize array variables and the !? history operator.
<p>
Replaced \"Sections\" menu with \"Ids\" menu in HTML files.
<p>
Improved syntax highlighting of HTML/XML tags.  Closing tag gets same style as opening tag, if closing tag is not explicitly given a style.  Trailing slash is no longer treated as part of tag name.  Tag name takes precedence over XML namespace.
<p>
Fixed styling for JavaScript embedded in HTML so comments stop at &lt;/script&gt; tags.
<p>
Added support for yuidoc doctags in JavaScript.
<p>
Preserves file permissions when you press Ctrl-Return (to rename) in the file name input area at the bottom of an Editor window.
<p>
\"Replace all\" is now atomic, so a single undo reverts the entire operation.  (Finally!)
<p>
Added \"Show in file manager\" to File menu in Editor windows.  On OS X, <a href=http://yost.com/computers/MacStuff/reveal/index.html>this script</a> will display the file in the Finder.
<p>
Added option to import/export character actions from Actions &amp; Macros preference dialog.
<p>
Added option to turn off pasting via middle-click.
<p>
Fixed \"Open selection as file name or URL\" to work with URL's embedded in XML.
<p>
Fixed Control-space and Control-backspace so they only page when the editor is read-only.  This makes Control-space less annoying when used for symbol completion.
<p>
Optimized opening DOS-format and binary files.
<p>
Fixed bug that prevented dragging text from one docked window to another.
<p>
Fixed bug so correct line number is passed to commands when text lines wrap in window.
<p>
Fixed bug that caused Code Crusader to hang sometimes while editing Perl scripts.
<p>
Fixed bug in search/replace that caused replace to fail if the regular expression had look-behind or look-ahead assertions.
<p>
Fixed bug in <code>--diff</code> command line option so \"Redo diff\" button works when you specify relative paths.
<p>

<b> Miscellaneous </b>

<p>
Added \"New shell...\" item to File menu.
<p>
Added option to exclude paths when searching a directory tree in the Search Text dialog.  The exclusion list is a wildcard filter, just like the file name filter.
<p>
Added awareness of Xinerama, so it works better with 2 monitors.
<p>
Added \"Desktop\" button in all Choose File and Save File dialogs.
<p>
If you want to open a project via the \"Recent projects\" menu, but you do not want to reopen all the files that were open last time, hold down the Shift key while selecting the project from the menu.  (Technically, it inverts the \"Reopen text files when project is opened\" option in the Project Preferences dialog.)
<p>
Mouse wheel now scrolls smaller increments on OS X.
<p>
Added support for horizontal scrolling.  This is especially useful on Macintosh trackpads that support gestures.
<p>
Fixed <code>--vcs-commit</code> to never dock the window.
<p>
When Code Crusader is restarted without arguments, it now only restores the previously open documents once, instead of once per re-opened project.
<p>
Added <code>--quit</code> option which acts just like the \"Quit\" item on the File menu.
<p>
Ctrl-Page-Up/Down cycles through docked windows in a pane.
<p>
Each pane in the dock remembers the previously selected tab, so if you open a file and then close it again, you will return to the file you were working with.
<p>
Supports the latest updates to the <a href=http://newplanetsoftware.com/xdnd/>XDND protocol</a>.
<p>

<p>

<b> <a href=jxhelp:CBEditorHelp> Text Editor </a> </b>

<p>

<p>
Fixed lots of issues related to working with version control, e.g., CVS tab in \"Compare files\" dialog, check-out status in Project window, \"This task invokes version control\" flag for tasks, CVS-merge-friendly <code>.jcc</code> file, and preferences moved from <code>.jcc</code> to <code>.jup</code> file.
<p>

<b> <a href=jxhelp:CBProjectHelp> Project </a> </b>

<p>
Pressing Ctrl-Return after editing a file name renames the existing file.
<p>
Symbol browser now includes PHP defined constants, ASP variables, and Vim autocommand groups.  (requires ctags 5.5.4)

<p>

<b> <a href=jxhelp:CBEditorHelp> Text Editor </a> </b>

<p>
Replaced \"Read only\" checkbox with Settings menu to allow options for each individual window to be changed.
<p>
Added option in Settings menu to make whitespace visible.  For maximum readability, spaces between words are not drawn.

<p>
Added \"Open directory\" option to right-click Scripts menu.
<p>
Scripts menu no longer shows CVS and SCCS directories.

<p>
If menus do not fit on the menu bar, they are available in an overflow menu.
<p>
A menu will never again cover the menu bar when it is opened.  This prevents menu items from being accidentally selected with a click on the menu bar.
<p>
Added \"Tip of the Day\" to the Help menu.
<p>
Added \"Kill\" button in Compile and Run Output windows.  The \"Stop\" now sends SIGTERM instead of SIGKILL.  SIGTERM allows compilers to clean up temporary files before exiting.
<p>
Added <code>--dock</code> and <code>--no-dock</code> command line options.
<p>
Added option to Miscellaneous Preferences to warn when opening an old version of a project file, since after being opened, the file will no longer be readable by older versions of Code Crusader.

Fixed Search Text dialog so dropping a directory on the \"Search directory\" input area turns on the \"Search directory\" checkbox.
<p>
Fixed Windows menu to honor Macintosh/Windows shortcut style, i.e., in Windows mode, holding down the Control key now sets the active project.
