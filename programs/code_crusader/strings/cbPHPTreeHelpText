<title> PHP Class Tree </title>
</head>

The tree displays the inheritance relationships between the PHP classes that are found by parsing source files.
<p>
The names of interfaces, classes that are declared abstract, and classes that declare abstract functions are italicized.  If an interface or class is declared final, its name will be boldfaced.
<p>
If the parent of a class is not found in any of the files that are parsed, a \"ghost\" class is created to indicate this.  Ghost classes are drawn with a gray background.
<p>
To add classes to the tree, use the \"Add classes...\" item on the Tree menu.  (Classes in the Project window are always included in the tree.)  To update the current tree without quitting, use the \"Update\" item.  The <a href=jxhelp:CBFileTypeHelp>\"Edit file types...\"</a> item lets you set the suffixes for source files.  It is a good idea to add all the directories that contain source files, not just those that contain classes.  This way, when Code Crusader searches for a file (e.g. when you use \"Open selection\" in a Text Editor window), it is more likely to find it.
<p>
To locate a particular class, press the space bar and then type the first few letters in its name.  This search is case-insensitive and ignores the namespaces.  To then open the source file, press Return.  You do not have to de-iconify the window before typing.
<p>
To locate all classes that implement a particular function, select \"Find function\" from the Tree menu and then enter the name of the function to search for.  This is case sensitive.  If a single function is found, its definition will automatically be displayed.
<p>
If you click on a class in the Tree window:

<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt> Any button once (or type the first few characters of the name)
<dd> select the class
<p>
<dt> Shift key + any button once
<dd> select/deselect the class without deselecting other classes
<p>
<dt> Left button twice (or Return)
<dd> open source file for the class
<br> (opens documentation file if source can't be found)
<p>
<dt> Right button twice
<dd> open list of functions implemented by the class
</dl>
</blockquote>

There are also several <a href=jxhelp:CBEditorHelp#MouseShortcuts>shortcuts</a>
in the <a href=jxhelp:CBEditorHelp>built-in editor</a> that connect back to
the tree.

<a name=FunctionList>

<h3> Displaying the functions implemented by a class </h3>

To get a list of the functions that a class implements, either click on it and hold
for a moment to display a menu or right-double-click to create a new window.
<p>
The function names are colored to indicate whether they are public (black), default
(dark green), protected (brown, since yellow text on a white background is very
difficult to read), or private (red).  Italic indicates an abstract function.
<p>
The setting in the Tree Preferences dialog controls whether or not the menu and each new
window also displays the functions inherited from base classes.  If this is turned on,
functions implemented by the class itself are boldfaced to make them easy to find.
Changing the setting in the Tree Preferences dialog does not affect existing windows.
In these windows, there is a menu item on the Options menu that controls the display.
<p>
To locate a particular function, press the space bar and then type the first few
letters in its name.  This search is case-insensitive.
To then open the file containing the function's code, press Return.  You do not have to
de-iconify the window before typing.
<p>
If you click on a function name in a Function List window:

<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt> Any button once (or type the first few characters of the name)
<dd> select the function
<p>
<dt> Left button twice (or Return)
<dd> display source for the function
<p>
<dt> Right button twice
<dd> search the tree for all classes that implement the function
</dl>
</blockquote>

When using the menu, the mouse button that was pressed determines the action, just like
when double clicking in the window.
