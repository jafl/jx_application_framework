<h4> Experts will more likely be interested in
<a href=jxhelp:JXRegexHelp>Regular Expressions</a> </h4>

The text that will be affected is the text in the Text Editor window that was clicked or
typed in last.  The dialog is resizable, and the position and size are remembered.

<h3> Searching for text </h3>

Enter the text for which to search in the \"Search for\" input area.  The right \"Find\"
button searches for the next match and selects it, while the left \"Find\" button
searches for the previous match.
<p>
If \"Ignore case\" is checked, the search will not be case-sensitive.
If \"Wrap search\" is checked, the search will wrap around if it hits the
beginning or end of the text and will continue from the end or the beginning,
respectively.  If \"Entire words only\" is checked and the search text is also
entire words (e.g. \"hello\" or \"hi there\", but not \"this?\"), the search
will ignore matches that are part of other words.  As an example, \"and\" will
not match \"sand\".
<p>
If \"Regex search (egrep)\" is checked, the search text will be interpreted as a
<a href=jxhelp:JXRegexHelp>regular expression</a>.  The \"Ref\" button displays a
short reference summary of regular expression syntax.  If \"Treat as single line\"
is checked, the regex will be allowed to match across multiple lines.  Otherwise,
each match will only be allowed to extend until it reaches a newline character.
<p>
Clicking on the down arrow next to the \"Search for\" input area displays a menu
of the last 20 search patterns.  Selecting one copies it to the input area.
<p>
The right \"Find\" button has the shortcuts Return and Meta-G.  The left \"Find\"
button has the shortcuts Shift-Return and Meta-Shift-G.  The latter shortcuts are
the same as in the Text Editor window.

<h3> Replacing text </h3>

Enter the text with which to replace the currently selected match in the
\"Replace with\" input area.  The \"Replace\" button replaces the selected text if it
matches the current search text.  The \"Replace & Find\" buttons do the same and
then search for and select the next or previous match.  If \"Wrap search\" is
checked, the \"Replace all\" buttons search for all matches in the specified direction
starting from the beginning or end of the text and replace each one.  Otherwise, they
search for all matches starting from the current caret position or selection and
replace each one, stopping at the beginning or end of the text.
<p>
If \"Regex replace\" is checked, the replace pattern will be interpreted as a
<a href=jxhelp:JXRegexHelp#Replace>regular expression</a>.  Note that the shortcut
for toggling this checkbox is Meta-Shift-X, because Meta-X is the shortcut for
\"Regex search.\"
<p>
If \"Preserve case\" is checked, the case of the replace text will be adjusted to
match that of the matched search text, when possible.  This is primarily useful
when performing a case-insensitive search.  The rules for when the case is adjusted
are as follows:

<ol>
<li> If the texts have the same length, the case of each character is adjusted
     separately.  For example, matching \"aBc\" and replacing with \"xyz\" produces
     \"xYz\".
<p>
<li> Otherwise, the first letter's case is adjusted, and then the rest of
     the letters' cases are adjusted if all but the first letter in the matched
     text have the same case.  For example, matching \"aBC\" and replacing with
     \"wxyz\" produces \"wXYZ\", while matching \"AbC\" produces \"Wxyz\".
</ol>

Clicking on the down arrow next to the \"Replace with\" input area displays a menu
of the last 20 replace patterns.  Selecting one copies it to the input area.
<p>
The \"Replace\" button has the shortcut Meta-=.  The right \"Replace & Find\"
button has the shortcut Meta-L.  The left \"Replace & Find\" button has the
shortcut Meta-Shift-L.  These are the same shortcuts as in the Text Editor window.

<h3> Searching for text in multiple files </h3>

If \"Search directory\" is checked, the right \"Find\" button will search each file that matches the wildcard filter in the specified directory.  If you specify a relative path, it will be relative to the directory containing the active project, if any.  If \"Search all subdirectories\" is checked, all subdirectories will also be searched, except those specified in the exception list.  The exception list is a wildcard filter, just like the file name filter.  (Symbolic links are not followed to avoid infinite loops.)  If \"Invert\" is checked next to the wildcard filter, all files that do <em>not</em> match the given filter will be searched.
<p>
If \"Search files\" is checked, the right \"Find\" button will search each
text file in the list.
<p>
These two \"Search ...\" checkboxes can be turned on at the same time.
The checkboxes on the Options menu apply to both.
<p>
The output window will display each line that contains a match, underlining
the text that matches.  (If a file in the list is binary, it will not be
searched.) The search is performed in the background, so you can continue
to work.  The Search Results window displays a progress indicator to show
how much has been done.
<p>
As soon as each result is added to the Search window, you can open the file to
see the match by <a href=jxhelp:CBEditorHelp#MouseShortcuts>Control-double-clicking</a>
on the file name or by using the Matches menu.
<p>
If you only want a list of the files that contain matches, turn off the \"Show text of
each match\" option on the Files menu.  If you want a list of the files that do
<em>not</em> contain matches, turn on the \"List files that do not match\" option.
<p>
The list of files acts just like all other lists in Code Crusader.  You can search
for a file by clicking on the list and then typing the first few letters in the name.
A separate <a href=jxhelp:CBMiscHelp#MultiSelect>help section</a> explains how to
select more than one file at a time.  Since the Return key triggers the \"Find\" buttons,
you can open the selected files with Meta-Return.  (Double-clicking also works,
of course, though only for a single file.)  The Backspace key removes the selected
files from the list.
<p>
You can add files to the list by:

<ul>
<li> using the \"Add files...\" item on the Files menu
<p>
<li> dragging them from any
     <a href=http://www.newplanetsoftware.com/xdnd/>XDND</a> compliant file manager <br>
     (You can also drag files from this list to such file managers.)
<p>
<li> dragging files from the <a href=jxhelp:CBFileListHelp>File List</a> window <br>
     (shown via the \"Show file list\" menu item in the Project, Symbol, and class tree windows)
<p>
<li> dragging classes from the class trees <br>
     (This adds both the source and header file for C++.)
<p>
<li> use the <tt>--search</tt> option on the command line <br>
     (e.g.  <tt>jcc --search source/*.cc headers/*.h misc/README.*</tt>)
</ul>

Since it can be quite a bit of work to specify exactly which files to search,
\"Save file set...\" on the Files menu lets you save the list so you can use it again
later by loading it via the \"Load file set...\" item.

<h3> Replacing text in multiple files </h3>

If \"Search files\" is checked, the right \"Replace all\" button will search each file
in the list, open the ones with matches, and replace all the matches.
This provides a second way to undo the changes, in addition to the \"Cancel\" button in
the progress window, because you can simply close a file without saving it.
<p>
This option is only available if you are using the
<a href=jxhelp:CBProjectHelp#ExtEditor>built-in editor</a>.

<h3> Sharing search parameters between programs </h3>

Since many programs allow you to search through text, Code Crusader has been designed to allow the search parameters to be automatically shared with other programs via the <a href=http://www.newplanetsoftware.com/xsearch/>XSearch protocol</a>.  The advantage of this is that you can use the \"Enter search string\" menu item in one program, the \"Enter replace string\" menu item in a second program, and then search and replace in a third program without ever having to use the clipboard to transfer any of the text.  All the other options in the Search Text dialog are also shared, so you can configure a search in one program and then use it in any other program that supports the protocol.
