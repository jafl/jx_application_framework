<title> File List Window </title>
</head>

This window is available via the \"Show file list\" item on the Project menu in
all the windows related to a project.  It displays every file on the project's
search paths that matches a suffix type from the list of types in the
<a href=jxhelp:CBFileTypeHelp>File Types</a> dialog.
<p>
To find a particular file in the list, simply type the first few characters of its name.
<p>
To display a subset of the files, you can use either a wildcard filter, which works
just like file globbing on the command line (i.e., <tt>?</tt> for a single unknown
character, and <tt>*</tt> for more than one unknown character), or a
<a href=jxhelp:JXRegexHelp>regular expression</a>.
<p>
To display a file in a file manager, use the \"Show selected files in file manager\" item on the List menu.  The command that is used is determined by the \"File manager preferences...\" item on the Preferences menu.
