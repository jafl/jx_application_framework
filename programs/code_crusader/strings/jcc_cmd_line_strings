"Code Crusader $version

$copyright

This X application provides a plain text editor and a UNIX development
environment.

Because Code Crusader fully supports the Multiple Document concept,
it can be safely invoked from the command line or via a file manager
as often as you like.

Usage:
  project_file_name
  +line_number text_file_name
  text_file_name:line_number

--help             prints this help

-display           display_name : connect to the specified X display
--quit             same as Quit option on File menu; for switching displays

Note that the --man option is designed so you can alias \"man\" to \"jcc --man\"
and \"apropos\" to \"jcc --apropos\".  (Of course, this will only work if you
are running X.)

If you select an external editor (e.g. emacs or vi), then you must start Code
Crusader with a project file.  Otherwise, it will quit immediately.  You can
use the special option --turn-off-external-editor to get out of this situation
if you do not have any project files."
