Shell support is provided to allow easy capturing and editing of program output.  It does not provide any terminal support.  The existing terminals, e.g., <code>xterm</code>, already do an excellent job.
<p>
To start a shell window, select \"New shell...\" on the File menu.  Your default command shell, set via <code>chsh</code>, is used when you open the window.
<p>
Text that you type is displayed bold to make it easy to find.  Pressing return sends the bold text <em>containing the caret</em> to the shell as a command.
<p>
While annotating output, press Shift-Return to insert a line break without sending your comments to the shell.
<p>
Since there is no terminal support, the following commands invoke Code Crusader:

<ul>
<li> more
<li> less
<li> vi
<li> man
<li> apropos
</ul>
