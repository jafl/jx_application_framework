The following options can be changed in the Tree Preferences dialog:

<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt> Font size
<dd> This menu lets you change the font size used in the Tree and Function List windows.
<p>
<br>
<dt> Show inherited functions in lists
<dd> If this is checked, the popup menu and all newly created windows will display both
     the functions implemented by the class and the functions inherited from all base
     classes.  The functions implemented by the class will be boldfaced to make them
     easy to find.
<p>
<dt> Raise window if search matches single class
<dd> If there is only one match when you
     <a href=jxhelp:CBEditorHelp#MouseShortcuts>Meta-dbl-click</a> in an editor window,
     it is usually less disruptive if only the source file containing what you are
     looking for is displayed.  This will be the case if this item is not checked.
<p>
<br>
<dt> Automatically minimize MI link lengths
<dd> If this is checked, the multiple inheritance link lengths will be minimized every
     time the class tree is changed.  If this is not checked, you can use the \"Minimize
     MI link lengths now\" item on the Tree menu to do it when needed.  This option is
     provided because the optimal algorithm is exponential so it can take a long time if
     you make heavy use of multiple inheritance.
<p>
<dt> Draw MI links
<dd> Multiple inheritance links are much easier to follow if they are drawn on top of
     everything else.  However, sometimes it is better to drawn them underneath to
     minimize the clutter.
