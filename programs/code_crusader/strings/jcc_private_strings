"Code Crusader $version

$copyright

This X application provides a plain text editor and a UNIX development
environment.

Because Code Crusader fully supports the Multiple Document concept,
it can be safely invoked from the command line or via a file manager
as often as you like.

Usage:
  project_file_name
  +line_number text_file_name
  text_file_name:line_number

--help             prints this help
--version          prints version information
--iconic           files following this will open in iconified windows
--no-iconic        files following this will open in regular windows
--dock             files following this will open docked, if appropriate
--no-dock          files following this will open undocked, regardless
--force-reload     files following this will reload from disk if already open
--no-force-reload  turns off --force-reload
--reload-open      reload all open files from disk (also --force-reload-open)
--reopen           projects following this will reopen text files
--no-reopen        projects following this will not reopen text files
--man              page_name              : displays man page
--man              section_name page_name : displays man page from given section
--man              -k search_string       : displays list of relevant man pages
--apropos          search_string          : displays list of relevant man pages
--search           sets multifile search list to the remaining arguments
--add-search       adds the remaining arguments to the multifile search list
--diff             file1 file2 : compare two files
                   file dir : compare file with same name in dir
                   file : compare file with backup (~) or crash save (#)
--diff-silent      same as --diff, but don't report if files are identical
--cvs-diff         file : compare file with latest commit
                   r1 file : compare file with revision r1
                   r1:r2 file : compare file revision r1 with file revision r2
--cvs-diff-silent  same as --cvs-diff, but don't report if files are identical
--svn-diff         file : compare file with latest commit
                   r1 file : compare file with revision r1
                   r1:r2 file : compare file revision r1 with file revision r2
--svn-diff-silent  same as --svn-diff, but don't report if files are identical
--git-diff         file : compare file with latest commit
                   c1 file : compare file with commit c1
                   c1:c2 file : compare file commit c1 with file commit c2
--git-diff-silent  same as --git-diff, but don't report if files are identical
--vcs-commit       file_name : for use as Version Control System commit editor
-display           display_name : connect to the specified X display
--quit             same as Quit option on File menu; for switching displays

Note that the --man option is designed so you can alias \"man\" to \"jcc --man\"
and \"apropos\" to \"jcc --apropos\".  (Of course, this will only work if you
are running X.)

If you select an external editor (e.g. emacs or vi), then you must start Code
Crusader with a project file.  Otherwise, it will quit immediately.  You can
use the special option --turn-off-external-editor to get out of this situation
if you do not have any project files."
