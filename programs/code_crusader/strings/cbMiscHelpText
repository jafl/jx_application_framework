<h3> Design Philosophy </h3>

Code Crusader faithfully implements the Macintosh paradigm of allowing you to safely explore features by always providing the ability to undo the result.
<p>
If a menu item ends with ellipsis (...), this means that it opens a dialog that asks for more information and allows you to cancel if it wasn't what you
were looking for.

<h3> The Clipboard </h3>

By default, Code Crusader also follows the Macintosh clipboard model.  This means that text is <em>not</em> automatically copied when it is selected.  Instead, it is only copied when you use the \"Copy\" item on the Edit menu or Meta-C.  (Meta-C works in any input area, regardless of whether or not the window contains an Edit menu.)  The main advantage of this model is that paste can then replace the selected text.  If you prefer the X clipboard model, the <a href=jxhelp:CBEditorHelp#Prefs>Text Editor Preferences</a> dialog lets you use this instead.

<a name=Shortcuts>

<h3> Useful Shortcuts </h3>

On PC's, Meta is normally bound to the Alt key on the keyboard.  Your system's configuration may be different, however.  You can use \"<a href=jxhelp:#ModifierKeys><tt>xmodmap</tt></a>\" to examine and change this configuration.
<p>
<a href=jxhelp:CBEditorHelp#DND>Drag-And-Drop</a> can be cancelled by pressing the Escape key before releasing the mouse button.
<p>
Tab shifts focus to the next input area.  Shift-Tab shifts focus to the previous input area.
<p>
To use a shortcut for a button or checkbox, hold down the Meta key and press the underlined character.

<a name=Scrolling>

<h3> Scrolling </h3>

All scrollbars display increment/decrement arrow pairs if there is space.  Coupled with the Shift key which makes the arrows scroll a half page at a time, this conveniently packages all the scrolling functions in one place.
<p>
Clicking the middle button in a scrollbar forces the thumb to jump to the place where you clicked.
<p>
The arrow keys scroll the tree, read-only text, and help by small steps the way the scrollbar arrows do.  Meta-End and Meta-Page Up/Down scroll horizontally, just like
End and Page Up/Down scroll vertically.
<p>
To save your current position so you can easily jump back to it later, hold down the Meta key and click the left mouse button on the scrollbar thumb.  This creates a scrolltab.  Clicking on this scrolltab scrolls to the saved location.  You can place as many scrolltabs on each scrollbar as you wish.

<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt> Meta-left-click on scrollbar thumb
<dd> Place a scrolltab
<p>
<dt> Left-click on scrolltab
<dd> Jump to the saved position
<p>
<dt> Meta-left-click on scrolltab
<dd> Remove it
<p>
<dt> Meta-Shift-left-click on scrolltab
<dd> Remove all scrolltabs
</dl>
</blockquote>

These functions are also accessible via the menu that pops up when you right-click on the thumb or any scrolltab.
<p>
In the Project, Tree, and Text Editor windows, Control-1 through Control-9 scroll to the first through ninth vertical scrolltab, respectively.
<p>
If you have a <a href=http://www.inria.fr/koala/colas/mouse-wheel-scroll/>wheel mouse</a>, the wheel will scroll the widget that you point to:

<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt> No modifiers
<dd> Scroll five steps
<p>
<dt> Shift
<dd> Scroll one step
<p>
<dt> Control
<dd> Scroll one page
<p>
<dt> Meta
<dd> Scroll horizontally instead of vertically
</dl>
</blockquote>

<a name=FileChooser>

<h3> The File Chooser </h3>

Tab completion in the Path input field is supported, but only when the caret is at the far right of the text.  (This allows Tab to be used to switch to the next input area in all other situations.)  You don't actually need tab completion, however, because typing in the file list table performs an incremental search, after which you can use the following keys:

<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt> Up-arrow
<dd> Moves up one item
<p>
<dt> Down-arrow
<dd> Moves down one item
<p>
<dt> Left-arrow
<dt> Meta-up-arrow
<dd> Goes up one directory (just like clicking on the Up button)
<p>
<dt> Right-arrow
<dt> Meta-down-arrow
<dd> Enters the selected directory
<p>
<dt> Return
<dd> Enters the selected directory or chooses the selected file
</dl>
</blockquote>

Note that Meta-up-arrow and Meta-down-arrow work even if the file list table does not have focus.
<p>
The next sub-section describes how to select multiple files in the Choose Files dialog.
<p>
Double clicking a file in the Save File dialog copies the name to the input field.  This is useful if you want to replace a file or create a new file with a similar name.
<p>
The window is resizable, and always remembers its size and position.

<a name=MultiSelect>

<h3> Selecting more than one item in a list </h3>

If selecting more than one item at a time is possible in a particular list, you can do so with the following actions:

<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt> Left-click and drag
<dd> Selects files between where you click and where you release the button
<p>
<dt> Shift-left-click and drag
<dt> Right-click and drag
<dd> Selects files between where you last clicked and where you release the button
<p>
<dt> Shift-up/down-arrow
<dd> Selects files just like Shift-left-click
<p>
<dt> Control-left-click and drag
<dd> Selects/Deselects each file that you drag over
</dl>
</blockquote>

<h3> Editing items in a list or table </h3>

If you are editing an item in a list or a table, you can switch to a different item by using the following shortcuts:

<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt> Meta-up-arrow
<dt> Meta-8
<dt> Shift-Return
<dd> Moves up one row
<p>
<dt> Meta-down-arrow
<dt> Meta-2
<dt> Return
<dd> Moves down one row
<p>
<dt> Meta-left-arrow
<dt> Meta-4
<dt> Shift-Tab
<dd> Moves left one column
<p>
<dt> Meta-right-arrow
<dt> Meta-6
<dt> Tab
<dd> Moves right one column
</dl>
</blockquote>

The digits correspond to the appropriate positions on a numeric keypad.

<a name=ColorChooser>

<h3> Color Chooser </h3>

This dialog lets you create an arbitrary color via either the HSV or RGB color model.
<p>
HSV is implemented as a set of sliders because the values are meaningless.  Hue scans the color spectrum, Saturation can be set to the far left to obtain gray, and Value controls the brightness of the color.
<p>
RGB is provided as a set of values because it is primarily useful when requesting a known color, e.g. one obtained from a drawing program, <tt>xv</tt>, <tt>xmag</tt>, or <tt>xcmap</tt>.  For convenience, the input fields accept hex values prefixed by <tt>0x</tt>. (e.g. <tt>0xA4D3</tt>)

<a name=WindowManagement>

<h3> How to avoid fiddling with windows </h3>

Code Crusader's paradigm is to display information in many separate windows instead of trying to cram everything into a single window.  This allows you to easily place windows side by side so you can view more than one at a time and drag information from one to the other.  It also allows you to place different windows on different virtual desktops.  For those who prefer to work with all their windows arranged within a single window, refer to the section on <a href=jxhelp:JXDockHelp>Window Docks</a>.
<p>
You can call up any particular window by using the Windows menu.  To make it easier to navigate between windows without using the Windows menu, you should consider re-configuring your window manager/desktop to use the \"point to focus\" method and then adding a key shortcut that raises or lower the window that has focus.  This allows you to simply point to a window with the cursor and then press a key to bring that window to the front.
<p>
In addition, Code Crusader has several features that minimize the amount of effort required to deal with window placement and focus:

<ul>
<li> Dialogs and messages are centered on the screen and automatically grab keyboard focus so you don't have to move the mouse.
<p>
<li> \"Save window size as default\" item on Preferences menu lets you save the default size of each window type:
     <ul>
     <li> Project
     <li> Symbol browser
     <li> Class inheritance trees
     <li> File list
     <li> Source file
     <li> Header file (for languages that use it)
     <li> Other text files
     <li> Compile and Run output
     <li> Search output
     </ul>
     <p>
     This is especially useful for guaranteeing that source and header windows will appear side-by-side instead of on top of each other, and that the compile and run output will be displayed unobtrusively in a corner.
<p>
<li> Any dialog that can be resized will remember its position and size.
<p>
<li> The shortcuts Meta-0 through Meta-9 (on the Windows menu) work in all the non-modal dialogs, such as the Search Text, Find File, and Man Pages dialogs.
<p>
<li> Meta-W will close any non-modal window.
<li> Escape cancels and closes any dialog.
</ul>

Some window managers have an option that defeats Code Crusader's automatic window placement.  To avoid this, you can do the following:

<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt> fvwm
<dd> Comment out \"NoPPosition\" from <tt>~/.fvwmrc</tt>
<p>
<dt> fvwm2
<dd> Use \"UsePPosition\" instead of \"NoPPosition\" in <tt>~/.fvwm2rc</tt>
<p>
<dt> sawfish
<dd> Select the Placement item for Sawfish in the Gnome control panel and change the Method to \"None\".
<p>
<dt> twm
<dd> Set \"UsePPosition on\" in <tt>~/.twmrc</tt>
</dl>
</blockquote>

Window managers like KDE and Gnome that provide a taskbar listing all the currently open windows allow you to filter this list based on the window's title or WM_CLASS attribute.  Code Crusader sets WM_CLASS as follows:

<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt> Project window
<dd> Code_Crusader_Project
<p>
<dt> Symbol List window
<dd> Code_Crusader_Symbol_List
<p>
<dt> Tree window
<dd> Code_Crusader_Tree
<p>
<dt> File List window
<dd> Code_Crusader_File_List
<p>
<dt> Text Editor window
<dd> Code_Crusader_Editor
<p>
<dt> Run Output window
<dd> Code_Crusader_Editor_Exec_Output
<p>
<dt> Compiler Output window
<dd> Code_Crusader_Editor_Compile_Output
<p>
<dt> Search Output window
<dd> Code_Crusader_Editor_Search_Output
<p>
<dt> Dock window
<dd> JX_Dock
<p>
<dt> Help window
<dd> JX_Help_Browser
</dl>
</blockquote>

The setting for the Compiler Output window allows you to either filter out all text windows with <tt>Code_Crusader_Editor*</tt> or filter out all other text windows with simply <tt>Code_Crusader_Editor</tt>.  It is often convenient to display the Compiler Output window on the taskbar because the *** disappears when the compiler is finished.

<a name=ModifierKeys>

<h3> Remapping modifier keys </h3>

You can choose which keys on your keyboard should map to each modifier by using <tt>xmodmap</tt> in your <tt>~/.xinitrc</tt> file.  As an example, if you have a PC keyboard with the new Windows key between Ctrl and Alt, you can change the left Windows key to produce the Mod4 modifier as follows:

<blockquote><tt>
xmodmap -e \"clear mod4\" <br>
xmodmap -e \"keycode 115 = Super_L\" <br>
xmodmap -e \"add mod4    = Super_L\" <br>
</tt></blockquote>

To check which keys produce each modifier, use <tt>xmodmap -pm</tt>.
<p>
You can use <tt>xev</tt> to get the keycode for a particular key on your keyboard.  Run it from a terminal window, move the cursor into the resulting window, press the key, and check the keycode value that is printed.
