Installing Code Crusader:

The easiest way to install is to run:  sudo ./install

Otherwise, the programs (jcc, makemake, ctags, dirdiff) need to be placed
in a directory that is on your execution path.  /usr/bin or ~/bin are
usually good choices.  Copy the libraries in lib/ to a directory on your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

The project_templates and text_templates directories should be copied to
~/.jxcb/

The macros files can be loaded into Code Crusader by using the "Macros..."
item on the Preferences menu in any Editor window.

The CPM_rules files can be loaded into Code Crusader by using the "Clean
paragraph margin rules..." item on the Preferences menu in any Editor
window.

Notes on Code Crusader:

Code Crusader is a graphical development environment for UNIX.

The on-line help explains all the features of the program.

Since we use Code Crusader for all our development, we guarantee that it
will continue to improve.  We have a very long list of features that we
intend to implement, so please tell us what features you need, so we will
know which ones on our list to implement first.

Menu items that seem to be permanently disabled are features waiting
to be implemented.

The C++ parser in Code Crusader is home-grown and therefore not up to
parsing all valid C++ header files.  It parses JX correctly, but it can be
confused by g++.  This does not cause serious problems, however, because it
usually only affects the functions that Code Crusader thinks are
implemented by particular classes.
