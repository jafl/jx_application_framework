It´s actually this simple.
The PHP code can only be found in <?php ... ?> tags in an html page. Owever it´s
true one can ´echo´ or ´printf´ some html code¸ the main purpose of PHP is to
provide C-like tests and loops structures. There is no real need for PHP
key-words highlighting : when you do PHP¸ what you want is to separate visualy
the HTML parts and and the PHP parts¸ in such structures as :

<html><body>
<center>Menu</center><p>
<?php
  if($choice)
  {
    // here exit the tag to do some HTML
?>
<h1>Good Choice</h1><br>
<?php
    // here come back to PHP mode
    // continuing the if at the exact place we lefted it
  }
  else
  {
    printf("<h1>Bad Choice</h1><br>");
  }
?>
</body></html>

As you can see¸ you can either exit the PHP tag to do HTML¸ or printf the HTML.
But the important thing is that even exiting the PHP tag¸ the PHP statement
´if´ is left unfinished¸ and we can resume the PHP code  in the next PHP tag.
It´s quite useful in the next example :

Name:<input type=text name="nomp" value="<?php echo $myname ?>">

The tiny PHP tag is used to echo a variable.

You can imagine that there is really two different and interlaced codes : the
HTML and the PHP. What I´m saying here is that highlighting the HTML one way
and the PHP an other way would be a major improvement¸ because one could
really follow the two different codes easilly. And it seems easy to achieve.
Highlighting the PHP like C/C++ is would be nice¸ but looks painful to do and
would only be a cosmetic change (except for C++ like comments : // and /*...*/¸
not very important).
You don´t want to wait a complet PHP support when a small hack would do 90% of
the job¸ do you ? ;-)

Please find enclosed a sample php source I use. I used jcc with the following
HTML Style to edit it : Tag underligned+darkred¸ ?php bold+black

Regards¸
Eric

PS: I found a bug in jcc : when the mouse cursor is in a menu¸ pressing ALT¸
CONTROL¸ SHIFT or CapsLock makes a core dump. (I didn´t try other keys)
PPS : the italic style doesn´t seem to work for highlighting. It works for the
help window.
