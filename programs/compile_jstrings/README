	longer than 2040 characters.

1.0.3
	Fixed bug so safety save files are ignored.

1.0.2

compile_jstrings

    Translating a program into a different language is a nightmare unless all
the strings are stored separately from the source code.  In order to emulate the
Macintosh method of storing strings in a separate resource file, JX provides
JStringManager which loads a string database file during program initialization
to override the default strings compiled into the binary.  With this system, a
user only has to place the appropriate database file in either
~/.jx/string_data/ or /usr/lib/jx/string_data/.

    compile_jstrings was written to allow merging multiple database files (e.g.
one for the application and one for each library) into a single file that a
translator can work on and also to generate a source file defining a char* that
the program can pass to JStringManager (usually via the JXApplication
constructor) to define the default strings.

    For information on the exact arguments for running compile_jstrings, please
run "compile_jstrings --help"

    The format of the string database files is explained in
libjcore/code/JStringManager.cc.
