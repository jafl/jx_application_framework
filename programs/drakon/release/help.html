<h2><a name="GPMOverviewHelp">Overview of Drakon Process Manager</a></h2>

<p>Drakon provides a graphical display of the system status and running processes and lets you pause or terminate processes.</p>


<hr>
<h2><a name="GPMMainHelp">Main Window</a></h2>

<p>The main window displays:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>CPU history as a scrolling bar chart</dt>
	<dd>Green indicates your processes.  Red indicates other processes.</dd>
	<br>
	<dt>Memory usage as a pie chart</dt>
	<dd>Green indicates free memory.  Red indicates memory used by your processes.  Dark red indicates other used memory.</dd>
	<br>
	<dt>Running processes</dt>
	<dd>Either in a list or a tree</dd>
</dl>

<p>By default, only your own processes are shown.  You can change this, by turning on "Show processes for all users."</p>

<p>You can sort by the values in a column by clicking the column title.</p>

<p>The leftmost column shows the status of each process.  A green dot indicates the the process is running.  A red dot indicates that the process is paused.  You can change the state by clicking the dot.  An X indicates that the process is a "zombie."  This means that the process is dead, but has not yet been cleaned up by the system.</p>

<p>You can right-click on a process in the list for a menu of actions.</p>

<p>Ending a process is the nice way to do it.  It gives the process a chance to clean up.  Killing a process is the brutal way.  This should only be done if the the process refuses to end nicely.</p>

<p>Re-nicing a process lowers its priority so it only gets a chance to work when other processes are idle.</p>
