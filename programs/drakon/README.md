Installing
==========

The easiest way to install from the binary package is to run `sudo ./install`

Otherwise, the program (drakon) should be placed in a directory that is on your execution path.  `/usr/bin` or `~/bin` are usually good choices.  Copy the libraries in `lib/` to a directory on your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.


Requirements
============

On MacOS, this program requires XQuartz, the X11 server.  Before running this program, you must first start XQuartz.

You also need to `brew install ace icu4c pcre gd`.


Notes
=====

Drakon provides a graphical display of the processes running on your UNIX machine.  The on-line help explains all the features of the program.
