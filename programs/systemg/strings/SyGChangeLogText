<p>
Added preference to open folders either in the same window or in new windows.
<p>
Added preference to not save per-folder preferences in <code>.systemg_folder_prefs_*</code>.
<p>

<h3> 2.4 </h3>

Renamed Branch menu to Git.  Add more functions and restructured contents based on the frequency of use of each item.  Git menu is now always visible, to allow items to be added to the toolbar, but the menu is only enabled in top level directories managed by git, not sub-directories.
<p>

<p>
No longer blocks when opening a directory mananged by git.
<p>

<h3> 2.3 </h3>

Added \"Find...\" option on File menu.
<p>
Finally added context menu.
<p>
If directory is managed by Subversion or Git, attempts to use that when moving, renaming, and deleting files.
<p>
If the directory is managed by Git, the Branch menu displays the list of available branches, lets you switch between them, and provides other common functions.
<p>
If you hold down the Meta key while selecting an item from the \"Open recent\" menu, it will treat it like \"Alternate open\".
<p>
Added <code>--force-new</code> and <code>--no-force-new</code> command line options.  The latter asks System G to display the file in an existing window, if possible.
<p>
Enhanced drag-and-drop to allow dropping on writable folder inside non-writable window.
<p>
Fixed creation of symbolic links to only append \"_alias\" if the original name is already used in the destination directory.
<p>
Fixed displaying of files so it does <em>not</em> dereference symlinks before it decides what to select.
<p>

<p>

Added \"Open recent\" menu.
<p>
Added \"Convert to file\" and \"Convert to program\" items to File menu.
<p>
Added \"New text file\" to the File menu.
<p>

<p>
Updating is now much faster, and it works well with slow network file systems like <a href=http://fuse.sourceforge.net/sshfs.html><tt>sshfs</tt></a>.
<p>
No longer opens CVS and SCCS directories when Shift-click or Meta-click.
<p>

Execute permissions are ignored for files on VFAT partitions.
<p>

<p>
Added F2 shortcut for renaming and F5 shortcut for refreshing the display.
<p>
Holding down Control now selects multiple items, just like Shift always has done.
<p>
When using Windows menu shortcuts, file dragging modifiers also adjust so Control toggles copy/move, Meta creates a symbolic link, and Shift asks what action to take.
<p>
Now installs correctly into the Start Menu in Gnome 2.
<p>
Fixed bug that occasionally caused a window to remain blank after switching to its desktop in Gnome 2.
<p>

<p>
<a href=jxhelp:JFSRunCommandHelp>Run dialog</a> accepts partially quoted arguments, e.g., newplanetsoftware.com:'*.tgz'
<p>
Drag source in lower left corner of window now supports Copy, Move, Link, and Ask actions.
<p>
Windows menu is alphabetized to make it useful.
<p>
File no longer disappears out from under the cursor when you click to start dragging immediately after renaming the file.
<p>
When a file is renamed, the window scrolls to show the file after the list is resorted.
<p>
Dragging a selection rectangle so the top is outside the window now correctly selects files.
<p>
A period followed by only digits is no longer considered a file suffix.
<p>
You can change the menu font by creating <tt>~/.jx/menu_font</tt>.  The first line in the file must be the font name.  The second line in the file must be the font size.
<p>
Increased indent of folder contents to make it easier to read.
<p>
When window is opened to display a file, and the display has to be scrolled, the file no longer ends up hidden under the horizontal scrollbar.
<p>
When you open a folder by clicking on the arrow to the left of the icon, the display scrolls to show the contents of the folder.
<p>
Added \"Mac/Win/X emulation...\" item to Preferences menu to provide option to choose between Macintosh and Windows style menu shortcuts.  (This assumes that you have not changed Meta to Ctrl in the menu_strings file.)
<p>
Fixed bug that displayed wrong size for gigabyte sized files.
<p>
Fixed bug so \"Alternate open\" on File menu no longer causes crash if more than one executable file is selected.
<p>

<p>
Fixed bug so dragging NFS mounted folder to trash no longer causes crash.
<p>
Fixed path display at bottom of window to use ~ notation for NFS mounted folders.

<h3> 2.0.0 </h3>

Redesigned <a href=jxhelp:SyGFileHelp#Deleting>trash can interface</a>.
<p>
Redesigned <a href=jxhelp:JFSBindingEditorHelp>file binding interface</a>.  Added several new \"Open\" items to File menu.  Added \"Run command...\" item to File menu to allow running commands that do not involve a particular file.  Changed location of system-wide binding list to <tt>/usr/lib/jx/jfs/file_bindings</tt>.
<p>
If you open a mount point and nothing is mounted there, System G automatically tries to mount it.  When you close the window, it will be automatically unmounted again.  (We are working on the problem of automatically detecting that a disk has been inserted.)
<p>
<a href=jxhelp:SyGFolderHelp#Shortcuts>Shortcuts menu</a> includes mount points and has Ctrl-# keyboard shortcuts.  All shortcuts can be placed on the toolbar.  Unfortunately, all the shortcuts that you add will have the same icon, but the hint for each button displays the path.
<p>
Added \"Mount\"/\"Unmount\" menu item to View menu.  This is enabled if the directory is a mount point that you have permission to mount.
<p>
Holding down Shift while dragging files creates aliases.
<p>
You can now drop on iconified windows, including the trash can.  (assuming that your window manager supports iconified windows instead of only displaying them in a task bar)
<p>
If the drop target is not the window's folder, then it is indicated by highlighting the arrow at the left of the folder icon.  This avoids confusion in the case when the folder is selected, and the icon is consequently already highlighted.
<p>
If the mouse is not over the icon or the name, then the drop target is the window's folder.  This allows dropping on the window's folder in the case when it contains only folders and there is no blank space at the bottom.
<p>
Implemented \"Copy\" and added \"Copy with path\" to Edit menu.
<p>
Added <tt>--choose</tt> and <tt>--run</tt> command line options.
<p>
When you create a new directory, it will automatically start editing the name.
<p>
Path input at bottom of window uses and accepts ~ notation.
<p>
Copying, moving, and duplicating files is now done in the background.
<p>
No longer displays size or permissions for aliases since these values are meaningless.
<p>
Removed Home button from bottom of window since there is a menu item that does this.
<p>
Replaced Up button at bottom of window with folder icon.  Dragging from this icon drags the URL of the directory displayed in the window.  Click and hold for a moment on this icon to get a menu allowing you to move up the directory hierarchy.  Hold down the Meta key while selecting from this menu to avoid opening a new window.
<p>
When you stay in the same window and go up to the enclosing folder, the folder from which you came is selected.
<p>
Closed sub-directories are now properly updated.
<p>
Folder prefs file name now includes user name so multiple users can open the same folder without stepping on each other's preferences.
<p>
Folder prefs file now includes scroll position.
<p>
Fixed bug so when a folder is renamed, the items that it contains do not become invalid.
<p>
Fixed bug so folders containing a backslash in their names can be deleted.
<p>
Fixed bug so when you open a directory, the window will never be iconified.
<p>
Fixed bug so leaving path input without changing it won't close open sub-folders.
<p>
Improved updating of directory contents over NFS.
<p>
Improved Drag-And-Drop cursors.
