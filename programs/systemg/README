Installing System G:

The easiest way to install is to run:  sudo ./install

Otherwise, the program (systemg) need to be placed in a directory that is
on your execution path.  /usr/bin or ~/bin are usually good choices.  Copy
the libraries in lib/ to a directory on your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.


Running System G:

If System G crashes or if you find other bugs, please check the web page
first to see if they have already been reported.

On OS X, this program requires XQuartz, the X11 server.  Before running
this program, you must first start XQuartz.



Notes on System G:

System G provides a graphical interface to the UNIX file system.

The on-line help explains all the features of the program.

Since we use System G extensively, we guarantee that it will continue to
improve.  We have a very long list of features that we intend to implement,
so please tell us what features you need, so we will know which ones on our
list to implement first.

Menu items that seem to be permanently disabled are features waiting
to be implemented.
