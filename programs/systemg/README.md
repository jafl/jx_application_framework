Installing
==========

The easiest way to install from the binary package is to run `sudo ./install`

Otherwise, the program (systemg) should be placed in a directory that is on your execution path.  `/usr/bin` or `~/bin` are usually good choices.  Copy the libraries in `lib/` to a directory on your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.


Requirements
============

On MacOS, this program requires XQuartz, the X11 server.  Before running this program, you must first start XQuartz.

You also need to `brew install ace icu4c pcre gd`.


Notes
=====

System G provides a graphical interface to the UNIX file system.  The on-line help explains all the features of the program.

Since we use System G extensively, we guarantee that it will continue to improve.  We have a very long list of features that we intend to implement, so please tell us what features you need, so we will know which ones on our list to implement first.
