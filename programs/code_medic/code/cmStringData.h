Your system's configuration may be different, however.  You can use \\\"<a href=jxhelp:#ModifierKeys><tt>xmodmap</tt></a>\\\" to examine and change this configuration.\n<p>\nDrag-And-Drop can be cancelled by pressing the Escape key before releasing the mouse button.\n<p>\nTab shifts focus to the next input area.  Shift-Tab shifts focus to the previous\ninput area.\n<p>\nTo use a shortcut for a button or checkbox, hold down the Meta key and press the\nunderlined character.\n\n<a name=Scrolling>\n\n<h3> Scrolling </h3>\n\n<p>\nAll scrollbars display increment/decrement arrow pairs if there is space.  Coupled with the Shift key which makes the arrows scroll a half page at a time, this conveniently packages all the scrolling functions in one place.\n<p>\nClicking the middle button in a scrollbar forces the thumb to jump to the place where you clicked.\n<p>\nThe arrow keys scroll the tree, read-only text, and help by small steps the way the\nscrollbar arrows do.  Meta-End and Meta-Page Up/Down scroll horizontally, just like\nEnd and Page Up/Down scroll vertically.\n<p>\nTo save your current position so you can easily jump back to it later, hold down the Meta key and click the left mouse button on the scrollbar thumb.  This creates a scrolltab.  Clicking on this scrolltab scrolls to the saved location.  You can place as many scrolltabs on each scrollbar as you wish.",
"\n\n<blockquote>\n<dl>\n<dt> Meta-left-click on scrollbar thumb\n<dd> Place a scrolltab\n<p>\n<dt> Left-click on scrolltab\n<dd> Jump to the saved position\n<p>\n<dt> Meta-left-click on scrolltab\n<dd> Remove it\n<p>\n<dt> Meta-Shift-left-click on scrolltab\n<dd> Remove all scrolltabs\n</dl>\n</blockquote>\n\nThese functions are also accessible via the menu that pops up when you right-click on the thumb or any scrolltab.\n<p>\nIn the Project, Tree, and Text Editor windows, Control-1 through Control-9 scroll to the first through ninth vertical scrolltab, respectively.\n<p>\nIf you have a <a href=http://www.inria.fr/koala/colas/mouse-wheel-scroll/>wheel mouse</a>, the wheel will scroll the widget that you point to:\n\n<blockquote>\n<dl>\n<dt> No modifiers\n<dd> Scroll five steps\n<p>\n<dt> Shift\n<dd> Scroll one step\n<p>\n<dt> Control\n<dd> Scroll one page\n<p>\n<dt> Meta\n<dd> Scroll horizontally instead of vertically\n</dl>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\n\n<a name=FileChooser>\n\n<h3> The File Chooser </h3>\n\nTab completion in the Path input field is supported, but only when the caret is at the far right of the text.  (This allows Tab to be used to switch to the next input area in all other situations.)  You don't actually need tab completion, however, because typing in the file list table performs an incremental search, after which you can use the following keys:\n\n<blockquote>\n<dl>\n<dt> Up-arrow\n<dd> Moves up one item\n<p>\n<dt> Down-arrow\n<dd> Moves down one item\n<p>\n<dt> Left-arrow\n<dt> Meta-up-arrow\n<dd> Goes up one directory (just like clicking on the Up button)\n<p>\n<dt> Right-arrow\n<dt> Meta-down-arrow\n<dd> Enters the selected directory\n<p>\n<dt> Return\n<dd> Enters the selected directory or chooses the selected file\n</dl>\n</blockquote>\n\nNote that Meta-up-arrow and Meta-down-arrow work even if the file list table does not have focus.\n<p>\nThe next sub-section describes how to select multiple files in the Choose Files dialog.\n<p>\nDouble clicking a file in the Save File dialog copies t",
"he name to the input field.  This is useful if you want to replace a file or create a new file with a similar name.\n<p>\nThe window is resizable, and always remembers its size and position.\n<p>\n\n<a name=MultiSelect>\n\n<h3> Selecting more than one item in a list </h3>\n\nIf selecting more than one item at a time is possible in a particular list, you can do so with the following actions:\n\n<blockquote>\n<dl>\n<dt> Left-click and drag\n<dd> Selects files between where you click and where you release the button\n<p>\n<dt> Shift-left-click and drag\n<dt> Right-click and drag\n<dd> Selects files between where you last clicked and where you release the button\n<p>\n<dt> Shift-up/down-arrow\n<dd> Selects files just like Shift-left-click\n<p>\n<dt> Control-left-click and drag\n<dd> Selects/Deselects each file that you drag over\n</dl>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3> Editing items in a list or table </h3>\n\nIf you are editing an item in a list or a table, you can switch to a different item by using the following shortcuts:\n\n<blockquote>\n<dl>\n<dt> Meta-up-arrow\n<dt> Meta-8\n<dt> Shift-Return\n<dd> Moves up one row\n<p>\n<dt> Meta-down-arrow\n<dt> Meta-2\n<dt> Return\n<dd> Moves down one row\n<p>\n<dt> Meta-left-arrow\n<dt> Meta-4\n<dt> Shift-Tab\n<dd> Moves left one column\n<p>\n<dt> Meta-right-arrow\n<dt> Meta-6\n<dt> Tab\n<dd> Moves right one column\n</dl>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe digits correspond to the appropriate positions on a numeric keypad.\n\n<a name=WindowManagement>\n\n<h3> How to avoid fiddling with windows </h3>\n\nCode Medic's paradigm is to display information in many separate windows instead of trying to cram everything into a single window.  This allows you to easily place windows side by side so you can view more than one at a time and drag information from one to the other.  It also allows you to place different windows on different virtual desktops.  For those who prefer to work with all their windows arranged within a single window, refer to the section on <a href=jxhelp:JXDockHelp>Window Docks",
"</a>.\n<p>\nWhen working with multiple windows, Code Medic has several features that minimize the amount of effort required to deal with window placement and focus:\n\n<ul>\n<li> Dialogs and messages are centered on the screen and automatically grab\n     keyboard focus so you don't have to move the mouse.\n<p>\n<li> Each window remember its position and size.\n<p>\n<li> Meta-W will close any non-modal window.\n<li> Escape cancels and closes any dialog.\n</ul>\n\nSome window managers have an option that defeats Code Medic's automatic window placement.  To avoid this, you can do the following:\n\n<blockquote>\n<dl>\n<dt> fvwm\n<dd> Comment out \\\"NoPPosition\\\" from <tt>~/.fvwmrc</tt>\n<p>\n<dt> fvwm2\n<dd> Use \\\"UsePPosition\\\" instead of \\\"NoPPosition\\\" in <tt>~/.fvwm2rc</tt>\n<p>\n<dt> sawfish\n<dd> Select the Placement item for Sawfish in the Gnome control panel and change the Method to \\\"None\\\".\n<p>\n<dt> twm\n<dd> Set \\\"UsePPosition on\\\" in <tt>~/.twmrc</tt>\n</dl>\n</blockquote>\n\nWindow managers like KDE and Gnome that provide a taskbar listing all the currently open windows allow you to filter this list based on the window's title or WM_CLASS attribute.  Code Medic sets WM_CLASS as follows:\n\n<blockquote>\n<dl>\n<dt> Command line window\n<dd> Code_Medic_Command_Line\n<p>\n<dt> Current source window\n<dd> Code_Medic_Source_Main\n<p>\n<dt> Other source window\n<dd> Code_Medic_Source\n<p>\n<dt> Threads window\n<dd> Code_Medic_Threads\n<p>\n<dt> Stack trace window\n<dd> Code_Medic_Stack\n<p>\n<dt> Variables window\n<dd> Code_Medic_Variables\n<p>\n<dt> Local variables window\n<dd> Code_Medic_Variables_Local\n<p>\n<dt> 1D array window\n<dd> Code_Medic_Variables_Array_1D\n<p>\n<dt> 2D array window\n<dd> Code_Medic_Variables_Array_2D\n<p>\n<dt> File list window\n<dd> Code_Medic_File_List\n<p>\n<dt> Disassembler window\n<dd> Code_Medic_Disassembler\n<p>\n<dt> Memory dump window\n<dd> Code_Medic_Memory\n<p>\n<dt> Help window\n<dd> JX_Help_Browser\n</dl>\n</blockquote>\n\n<a name=Modifier",
"Keys>\n\n<h3> Remapping modifier keys </h3>\n\nYou can choose which keys on your keyboard should map to each modifier by using <tt>xmodmap</tt> in your <tt>~/.xinitrc</tt> file.  As an example, if you have a PC keyboard with the new Windows key between Ctrl and Alt, you can change the left Windows key to produce the Mod4 modifier as follows:\n\n<blockquote><tt>\nxmodmap -e \\\"clear mod4\\\" <br>\nxmodmap -e \\\"keycode 115 = Super_L\\\" <br>\nxmodmap -e \\\"add mod4    = Super_L\\\" <br>\n</tt></blockquote>\n\nTo check which keys produce each modifier, use <tt>xmodmap -pm</tt>.\n<p>\nYou can use <tt>xev</tt> to get the keycode for a particular key on your keyboard.  Run it from an <tt>xterm</tt>, move the cursor into the resulting window, press the key, and check the keycode value that is printed.\n\n</html>\"\nCMJavaConfigFileHelp \"<html>\n<head>\n<title>Java Configuration File</title>\n</head>\n\nIn Java, the program to run is specified as a command line argument to the JVM, and the JVM does not know where the source files are.

Structures, objects, and pointers have an arrow to the left of their names.  Clicking on this arrow displays the variable's contents below its name.\n<p>\nWhenever the program pauses at a breakpoint, the values are updated automatically.  Values that have changed since the last pause are displayed in blue.  Variables and expressions that cannot be evaluated in the current context are displayed in gray.\n<p>\nThere are severals ways to display a variable or expression:\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li> Use the \\\"New expression\\\" item on the Actions menu and then type in the expression in the input field that is created.\n<li> Select the expression in a <a href=jxhelp:CMSourceWindowHelp>Source View</a> window and use the \\\"Display variable\\\" item on the Debug menu.\n<li> Double click with the middle mouse button on the text in the <a href=jxhelp:CMSourceWindowHelp>Source View</a> window.\n</ul>\n<p>\nYou can display the value of any arbitrary expression, not just a simple variable name.\n<p>\nTo display the value of a variable in a different base, either right-click on the variable or select it and then use the Base menu.  Note that this only works for unsigned integers.\n<p>\nTo change an expression that is being displayed, double click on it.  If the expression is inside a structure, it will be copied to a new line so you can edit it.\n<p>\nTo change the value of a variable, double click on it.  Note that this is only appropriate for simple variables.  To edit a string, you must first display it as an array of characters.  In addit",
"ion, an attempt to change the result of evaluating an expression containing mathematical operations will not succeed.  All errors are displayed in the <a href=jxhelp:CMCommandDirHelp>Command Line</a> window.\n\n<p>\nHere is the complete list of all the ways to view the contents of structures, objects, and pointers:\n\n<dl>\n<dt> Right-arrow\n<dt> Click on triangle when item is closed\n<dd> Open the item to display its contents.\n<p>\n<dt> Left-arrow\n<dt> Click on triangle when item is open\n<dd> Close the item.\n<p>\n<br>\n<dt> Meta-Right-arrow\n<dt> Meta-click on triangle when item is closed\n<dd> Open the item to display its contents and the contents of all the items that are contained within it.\n<p>\n<dt> Meta-Left-arrow\n<dt> Meta-click on triangle when item is open\n<dd> Close the item and all the items contained within it.  (If you only close the item itself, the contained items will remain open and be visible next time you open the item.)\n<p>\n<br>\n<dt> Shift-Right-arrow\n<dt> Shift-click on triangle when item is closed\n<dd> Open all items to display their contents.\n<p>\n<dt> Shift-Left-arrow\n<dt> Shift-click on triangle when item is open\n<dd> Close all items.\n</dl>\n\nThe keyboard shortcuts obviously only work when one or more items are <a href=jxhelp:CMMiscHelp#MultiSelect>selected</a>.\n\n<a name=Local>\n\n<h3> Local variables </h3>\n\nExamining the variables that are local to the current function is such a common task that a separate window is used to display the values of all the currently defined local variables.  This window works exactly the same way as the Variables window, except that double clicking on a variable name always transfers it to the Variables window instead of allowing you to edit in place.\n<p>\nThere is one caveat when using the Local Variables window.  Variables from enclosing blocks are displayed below the variables defined in the current block.  This is very useful for integers and other simple values.  However, if the same variable name is re-used, and it is a ",
"pointer in the outer block, then you will not be able to display the contents of the pointer while executing code in the inner block.\n\n<a name=Registers>\n\n<h3> Registers </h3>\n\nThe Registers window displays the current values in all the registers.  It updates automatically as you step through code.\n\n<a name=Array1D>\n\n<h3> Examining a one dimensional array </h3>\n\nTo examine the contents of a one dimensional array, select its name and then use the \\\"Display as 1D array\\\" item on the Debug menu in any Source window or the Actions menu in any Variables window.\n<p>\nThe window displays the expression to be evaluated and the range of elements at the top of the window.  When you tab out of any of the input fields or press Return, the list of values is automatically adjusted to match the new expression and range.\n<p>\nIf the elements in the array are structures, object, or pointers, they will each have an arrow to the left of the name, and you can use the same techniques as in the Variables window to display the contents of each item.  If you are only interested in a particular element of a structure, you can modify the expression, using <tt>$i</tt> as a placeholder for the array index.  As an example, \\\"<tt>x[$i].y</tt>\\\" will display element y for each of the items in the array x.  (If you omit <tt>[$i]</tt>, it will automatically be appended to the end of the expression.)\n\n<h3> Plotting a one dimensional array </h3>\n\nInstructions for plotting are provided in a <a href=jxhelp:CM2DPlotHelp>separate section</a>.\n\n<a name=Array2D>\n\n<h3> Examining a two dimensional array </h3>\n\nTo examine the contents of a two dimensional array, select its name and then use the \\\"Display as 2D array\\\" item on the Debug menu in any Source window or the Actions menu in any Variables window.\n<p>\nThe window displays the expression to be evaluated and the range of elements at the top of the window.  When you tab out of any of the input fields or press Return, the matrix of values is automatically ad",
"justed to match the new expression and range.  It is best to restrict the range to at most 100 rows and 100 columns.  This is typically the limit of what can be displayed on a large screen, and it also takes a very long time to update so many values.\n<p>\nThe window only works well if the elements are simple values.  If the elements in the array are structures, object, or pointers, you should modify the expression to focus on a particular element of the structure, using <tt>$i</tt> as a placeholder for the row index and <tt>$j</tt> as a placeholder for the column index.  As an example, \\\"<tt>x[$i][$j].y</tt>\\\" will display element y for each of the items in the array x.  (If you omit either index, it will automatically be appended to the end of the expression.)\n<p>\nAs with all windows that display data, to change a value in the table, simply double click on it.\n<p>\nTo transfer a value to the Variables window, hold down the Meta key while clicking on the value.\n<p>\nYou can change the widths of the columns by dragging the boundary between two columns in the column header.  If you hold down the Meta key while dragging, all the columns will be set to the new width.\n\n<a name=Memory>\n\n<h3> Examining memory </h3>\n\nTo examine memory, select either \\\"Examine memory\\\" or \\\"Disassemble memory\\\" from the Debug menu in any Source window or the Actions menu in any Variables window.  If you have selected an expression, it will automatically be copied to the Memory window.\n<p>\nThe window displays the expression for the starting memory location, the display format, and the number of items to display.  The expression can be a function name, pointer, or raw value.  When you tab out of any of the input fields or press Return, or select a different display format, the memory dump is automatically adjusted to match the new expression, format, and item count.\n\n</html>\"\nVCSConflict::CBProjectDocument \"This project file cannot be opened because it appears to contain unresolved Version Control confl",

The dialog is resizable, and the position and size are remembered.\n\n<h3> Searching for text </h3>\n\nEnter the text for which to search in the \\\"Search for\\\" input area.  The right \\\"Find\\\"\nbutton searches for the next match and selects it, while the left \\\"Find\\\" button\nsearches for the previous match.\n<p>\nIf \\\"Ignore case\\\" is checked, the search will not be case-sensitive.\nIf \\\"Wrap search\\\" is checked, the search will wrap around if it hits the\nbeginning or end of the text and will continue from the end or the beginning,\nrespectively.  If \\\"Entire words only\\\" is checked and the search text is also\nentire words (e.g. \\\"hello\\\" or \\\"hi there\\\", but not \\\"this?\\\"), the search\nwill ignore matches that are part of other words.  As an example, \\\"and\\\" will\nnot match \\\"sand\\\".\n<p>\nIf \\\"Regex search (egrep)\\\" is checked, the search text will be interpreted as a\n<a href=jxhelp:JXRegexHelp>regular expression</a>.  The \\\"Ref\\\" button displays a\nshort reference summary of regular expression syntax.  If \\\"Treat as single line\\\"\nis checked, the regex will be allowed to match across multiple lines.  Otherwise,\neach match will only be allowed to extend until it reaches a newline character.\n<p>\nClicking on the down arrow next to the \\\"Search for\\\" input area displays a menu\nof the last 20 search patterns.  Selecting one copies it to the input area.\n<p>\nThe right \\\"Find\\\" button has the shortcuts Return and Meta-G.  The left \\\"Find\\\"\nbutton has the shortcuts Shift-Return and Meta-Shift-G.  The latter shortcuts are\nthe same as in the Text Editor window.\n\n<h3> Replacing text </h3>\n\nEnter the text with which to replace the currently selected match in the\n\\\"Replace with\\\" input area.  The \\\"Replace\\\" button replaces the selected text if it\nmatches the current search text.  The \\\"Replace & Find",
"\\\" buttons do the same and\nthen search for and select the next or previous match.  If \\\"Wrap search\\\" is\nchecked, the \\\"Replace all\\\" buttons search for all matches in the specified direction\nstarting from the beginning or end of the text and replace each one.  Otherwise, they\nsearch for all matches starting from the current caret position or selection and\nreplace each one, stopping at the beginning or end of the text.\n<p>\nIf \\\"Regex replace\\\" is checked, the replace pattern will be interpreted as a\n<a href=jxhelp:JXRegexHelp#Replace>regular expression</a>.  Note that the shortcut\nfor toggling this checkbox is Meta-Shift-X, because Meta-X is the shortcut for\n\\\"Regex search.\\\"\n<p>\nIf \\\"Preserve case\\\" is checked, the case of the replace text will be adjusted to\nmatch that of the matched search text, when possible.  This is primarily useful\nwhen performing a case-insensitive search.  The rules for when the case is adjusted\nare as follows:\n\n<ol>\n<li> If the texts have the same length, the case of each character is adjusted\n     separately.  For example, matching \\\"aBc\\\" and replacing with \\\"xyz\\\" produces\n     \\\"xYz\\\".\n<p>\n<li> Otherwise, the first letter's case is adjusted, and then the rest of\n     the letters' cases are adjusted if all but the first letter in the matched\n     text have the same case.  For example, matching \\\"aBC\\\" and replacing with\n     \\\"wxyz\\\" produces \\\"wXYZ\\\", while matching \\\"AbC\\\" produces \\\"Wxyz\\\".\n</ol>\n\nClicking on the down arrow next to the \\\"Replace with\\\" input area displays a menu\nof the last 20 replace patterns.  Selecting one copies it to the input area.\n<p>\nThe \\\"Replace\\\" button has the shortcut Meta-=.  The right \\\"Replace & Find\\\"\nbutton has the shortcut Meta-L.  The left \\\"Replace & Find\\\" button has the\nshortcut Meta-Shift-L.  These are the same shortcuts as in the Text Editor window.\n\n<h3> Sharing search parameters between programs </h3>\n\nSince many programs al",
"low you to search through text, this program has been designed to allow the search parameters to be automatically shared with other programs via the <a href=http://www.newplanetsoftware.com/xsearch/>XSearch protocol</a>.  The advantage of this is that you can use the \\\"Enter search string\\\" menu item in one program, the \\\"Enter replace string\\\" menu item in a second program, and then search and replace in a third program without ever having to use the clipboard to transfer any of the text.  All the other options in the Search Text dialog are also shared, so you can configure a search in one program and then use it in any other program that supports the protocol.\n\n</html>\"\nobj2_JXLayout::CMArray1DDir::JXLayout \"Ending index:\"\nAddFilesPrompt::CBProjectTable \"Wildcard filter(s) for files to be added:\"\nitsUseSmallButtonsCB::JXToolBarEditDir::JXLayout \"Use small buttons\"\nDefaultMakemakeDependCmd::CBBuildManager \"makemake\"\nitsNextTipButton::JXTipOfTheDayDialog::JXLayout \"Next tip\"\nSaveForActive::CBRunCommandDialog \"For active project ($project)\"\nInitCommands::GDBLink \"echo \\\\032\\\\032:Medic command:0:\n\nset $medic_first_stop=0\n\nset width 0\nset height 0\nset print repeats 0\nset print asm-demangle on\nset print demangle on\n#set print pretty on\n#set print array on\nset print sevenbit-strings off\nset print union on\n\ndefine hook-quit\necho \\\\032\\\\032:Medic debugger quit:\nend\n\ndefine hook-start\necho \\\\032\\\\032:Medic program starting:\necho \\\\032\\\\032:Medic program running:\nend\n\ndefine hook-stop\nif $medic_first_stop\nset $medic_first_stop=0\necho \\\\032\\\\032:Medic acquire pid:\ninfo program\necho \\\\032\\\\032:Medic acquire pid end:\nend\nend\n\ndefine hook-file\necho \\\\032\\\\032:Medic loading file:\nend\n\ndefine hook-core-file\necho \\\\032\\\\032:Medic loading core:\nend\n\ndefine hook-attach\necho \\\\032\\\\032:Medic attaching:\nend\n\ndefine hook-detach\necho \\\\032\\\\032:Medic detaching:\nend\n\n\ndefine hook-next\necho \\\\032\\\\032:Medi",

To change a value, double click on it.  When you tab out of a cell or press Return, the plot is automatically adjusted to match the new expression and range.\n<p>\nThough the window intially plots the array index (<code>$i</code>) vs. the array value, it actually lets you to plot any expression vs. any other expression.  For example, if you have two arrays <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code>, you can enter <code>foo</code> in the X column and <code>bar</code> in the Y column.  You can even plot functions of array, e.g., <code>2*foo[$i-5]</code> vs. <code>bar[2*$i]/2</code>.  Note that you must include the array index explicitly when the expression is not a plain variable name.  Also note that you are limited to functions which <code>gdb</code> can evaluate.\n<p>\nYou can also plot multiple curves in a single window.  Click \\\"New\\\" to create a new plot.

In the Curve Options dialog, you can edit the name of a curve by clicking the curve name in the list at the left.  Note that the curve name will be reset if you change the expressions or range.\n<p>\nYou can change the X and Y scales of the plot in several ways. To view the \\\"Edit Plot Scale\\\" dialog box, select \\\"Change scale...\\\" from the Options menu or double-click\non the numbers displayed along either axis.  To zoom, click and drag the mouse to select a region of the plot.  If the Meta key is held down, the scale will be changed to the exact region contained by the zoom rectangle.  Otherwise, a reasonable scale will be chosen around the area of interest.  To return the scale to the default, select \\\"Reset scale\\\" from the Options menu.\n<p>\nThe range specifies what portion of the curves will be drawn, within the limits set by the axis scales.  To set the range, select \\\"Change range...\\\" from the Options menu.  An alternate method is to zoom in to the desired range, select \\\"Copy scale to range\\\" from the Options menu, and then reset the scale by selecting \\\"Reset scale\\\" from the Options menu.  You can clear the Range by selecting \\\"Clear range\\\" from the Options menu.\n<p>\nYou can edit the plot labels either by selecting \\\"Change labels...\\\" from the Options menu or by double-clicking on the appropriate label.

"l bug reports and suggestions for features to \n<a href=http://www.newplanetsoftware.com/nps/contact.php>New Planet Software</a>.\n<p>\n<hr>\n\n<h3> 3.3 </h3>\n\nEnabled \\\"Examine memory\\\" and \\\"Disassemble memory\\\" items on Debug menu.  Both now display a modeless window for examining memory at an arbitrary expression in several ways: hex dump, character dump, or assembly code.\n<p>\nAdded \\\"Disassemble function\\\" item to Debug menu.  This displays the assembly code for the selected function name.\n<p>\nDouble-clicking on the function name or address in the Breakpoints window displays the assembly code for the function.\n\n<h3> 3.2 </h3>\n\nBreakpoints window displays breakpoint, watchpoints, and catchpoints.\n<p>\nFixed parser to understand updated output for std::list.\n\n<h3> 3.1.1 </h3>\n\nWork around for strange X11 behavior that could cause Code Crusader to hang when run for the first time.\n\n<h3> 3.1 </h3>\n\n<b> Debugging </b>\n\n<p>\nUpdated breakpoint parsing to work with gdb 7.1.\n<p>\nAdded menu items for backward execution.\n<p>\nFixed bug so setting breakpoints works reliably on OS X.\n<p>\nFixed bug so run after quitting attached process works correctly.\n<p>\n\n<b> Miscellaneous </b>\n\n<p>\nAnti-alised text.\n<p>\nFixed window placement issues on OS X.\n<p>\n\n<h3> 3.0.1 </h3>\n\n<b> Debugging </b>\n\n<p>\nFixed bug to avoid losing program output.\n<p>\nUpdated to display contents of reference variables in Local Variables window when running gdb 7.\n<p>\nFixed bug so Kill works on OS X.\n<p>\nChoosing a program and running it is now much faster.\n<p>\n\n<h3> 3.0 </h3>\n\n<b> Major changes </b>\n\n<p>\nRefactored engine to allow different back ends.  Added support for <a href=\\\"http://www.xdebug.org/\\\">Xdebug 2.0</a>, a remote debugger for PHP.  When you choose a program to debug, Code Medic will automatically switch to the appropriate back end.  To force a particular back end, use the command line options <code>--gdb</code> and <code>--xdebug</code>.\n<p>\nRewrote gdb en",
"gine to use the GDB/MI interface.  Code Medic now requires gdb 6.0 or newer.\n<p>\nAdded \\\"Plot as 1D array\\\" menu item in Source and Variables windows.  This plots the selected variable as a 1D array.  In the <a href=jxhelp:CM2DPlotHelp>Plot window</a>, you can define additional curves, even plotting a function of one array vs. a function of another array.\n<p>\nWindow docking finally works with all window managers.\n<p>\n\n<b> Debugging </b>\n\n<p>\nUpdated to work with gdb 7.\n<p>\nNow recognizes when the program being debugged has changed and reloads the file list and all open source windows.\n<p>\n\\\"Run program\\\" automatically asks you to choose a program if you haven't already done so.  You no longer have to perform two separate steps.\n<p>\nFixed crash when opening certain types of nodes in any Variables window.\n<p>\nFixed issues to allow Code Medic to work with gdb when debugging Java compiled with gcj.  It's still useless, however, because gdb doesn't understand how to display the values of Java variables.\n<p>\nCleaned up Files window to eliminate duplicates.\n<p>\n\n<b> Source window </b>\n\n<p>\nFixes to work with files where lines are so long that text is forced to wrap.\n<p>\n\n<b> Variables and Array windows </b>\n\n<p>\nFixed variable parser to recognize template information within enum values, e.g., MyTemplate<int>::blue.\n<p>\nEnabled \\\"Display as 1D array\\\" and \\\"Display as 2D array\\\" in 2D Array windows.\n<p>\n\n<b> Miscellaneous </b>\n\n<p>\nAdded awareness of Xinerama, so it works better with 2 monitors.\n<p>\nAdded <code>--quit</code> option which acts just like the \\\"Quit\\\" item on the File menu.\n<p>\nAdded support for vi and emacs embedded configuration options:  tab-width for emacs and tabstop for vi.\n<p>\nCtrl-Page-Up/Down cycles through docked windows in a pane.\n<p>\nAdded \\\"Desktop\\\" button in all Choose File and Save File dialogs.\n<p>\nAutomatically quits if you close all windows. (Finally!)\n<p>\nRe-ordered menus in all windows so Edit always fol",
"lows File.\n<p>\nMouse wheel now scrolls smaller increments on OS X.\n<p>\nAdded support for horizontal scrolling.  This is especially useful on Macintosh trackpads that support gestures.\n<p>\n\n<h3> 2.1.2 </h3>\n\n<b> Debugging </b>\n\n<p>\nUpdated to work with idiosyncrasies of the OS X version of gdb:  recognizes when a core file has been loaded.\n<p>\n\n<h3> 2.1.1 </h3>\n\n<b> Debugging </b>\n\n<p>\nAdded \\\"Load configuration...\\\" and \\\"Save configuration...\\\" items to File menu in Current Source window.\n<p>\nUpdated to work with idiosyncrasies of the OS X version of gdb:  recognizes when a binary has been loaded.\n<p>\n\n<b> Miscellaneous </b>\n\n<p>\nFixed bug so window docks cannot be shrunk below a safe, minimum size.  Some windows may still pop out of the dock because they no longer fit, but the program will not crash.\n<p>\n\n<h3> 2.1.0 </h3>\n\n<b> Debugging </b>\n\n<p>\nAdded \\\"Load configuration...\\\" and \\\"Save configuration...\\\" items to File menu in Command Line window.  This saves the breakpoints and displayed variables so the debugging session can be quickly restored later.\n<p>\nOn Debug menu, changed shortcut for \\\"Step into\\\" to Meta-J, added shortcut Meta-K for \\\"Finish subroutine,\\\" Meta-Shift-N for \\\"Continue execution,\\\" and Ctrl-X for \\\"Remove all breakpoints.\\\"\n<p>\nUpdated to work with gdb 6.x.\n<p>\nFixed gdb crash recovery mechanism to restore breakpoint conditions.\n<p>\nFixed Stack Trace parser to ignore modifiers such as \\\"const\\\" in function prototypes.\n<p>\nFixed bug in Stack Trace parser that caused occasional crashes when parsing string data.\n<p>\nFixed Variables parser to ignore warnings printed by gdb.\n<p>\nFixed Files window to handle paths relative to the location of the binary.\n<p>\nFixed bug in Files window that would miss one source file from \\\"info sources.\\\"\n<p>\nCurrent Source window is raised when breakpoint is hit.\n<p>\nRegular expression search and replace now uses Perl syntax, thanks to the <a href=http://pc",
"re.org/>PCRE package</a>.\n<p>\n\n<b> Miscellaneous </b>\n\n<p>\n\\\"Dock all windows in default configuration\\\" is now active on docktab menu.\n<p>\nDocking configuration is now saved.\n<p>\nAdded File menu to all windows.\n<p>\nIf menus do not fit on the menu bar, they are available in an overflow menu.\n<p>\nA menu will never again cover the menu bar when it is opened.  This prevents menu items from being accidentally selected with a click on the menu bar.\n<p>\n\n<h3> 2.0.2 </h3>\n\n<b> Debugging </b>\n\n<p>\nUpdated Stack Trace window to handle new gdb format that includes function prototypes.\n<p>\nFixed Command Line window to not lose current command if user uses arrow keys to scroll up the history and then back down.\n<p>\n\n<b> Miscellaneous </b>\n\n<p>\nNow installs correctly into the Start Menu in Gnome 2.\n<p>\nFixed bug that occasionally caused a window to remain blank after switching to its desktop in Gnome 2.\n<p>\nFixed scrolltab shortcuts to be Meta-1..9 when Windows-style menu shortcuts are used.\n<p>\n\n<h3> 2.0.1 </h3>\n\n<b> Debugging </b>\n\n<p>\nCustom commands can now include ##.  This is replaced by the currently selected text, if any.\n<p>\nCustom commands are now available all the time, not only when a program is being debugged.\n<p>\n\n<b> Miscellaneous </b>\n\n<p>\nIf gdb crashes, you can now choose not to restart it automatically.\n<p>\nFixed bug to avoid crash when restarting gdb after it crashes.\n<p>\nFixed bug in Choose File and Save File dialogs so they remember the \\\"Show hidden files\\\" setting.\n<p>\nFixed bug so menu shortcuts which require the Shift key work even if Caps Lock is on.\n<p>\n\n<h3> 2.0.0 </h3>\n\n<p>\n<b> Major changes </b>\n<p>\nAdded support for <a href=jxhelp:CMThreadsHelp>threads</a>.\n<p>\nImproved support for <a href=jxhelp:CMBreakpointsHelp>breakpoints</a>, including conditional breakpoints, commands to execute when a breakpoint is hit, number of times to ignore a breakpoint, temporary breakpoints, and multiple breakpoints on a single line.",
"\n<p>\nExpressions and values in the <a href=jxhelp:CMVarTreeHelp>Variables</a> window are editable.\n<p>\nArray window allows an arbitrary expression to be entered with <tt>$i</tt> as a placeholder for the array index.\n<p>\n<a href=jxhelp:CMVarTreeHelp#Array2D>Two dimensional arrays</a> can now be displayed.\n<p>\nCode Medic can now debug Fortran programs compiled with g77 and Java programs compiled with gcj.\n<p>\n<a href=jxhelp:CMVarTreeHelp#Local>Local Variables</a> window now works like the Variables window.\n<p>\n\n<b> Debugging </b>\n\n<p>\nCore file can be opened without first selecting a program.  This feature is available on the command line via the <tt>-c</tt> option.\n<p>\nUpdates breakpoints when \\\"<tt>clear</tt>\\\" is used on the command line.\n<p>\nAutomatically restarts the debugger if it crashes.\n<p>\nFixed bug so Code Medic reliably beeps when program finishes or crashes.\n<p>\nWhen a core dump that was caused by an assert is opened, Code Medic selects the frame in which the assert fired.\n<p>\nIt is no longer necessary to choose the program binary before attaching to a running process.\n<p>\nAs a stop-gap until somebody can find a better solution, Code Medic will ask you to select the PID of the process being debugged if it cannot be obtained automatically.  This is mainly for those using threads, because gdb prints the thread information instead of the process information.\n<p>\nFixed bug so breakpoints can now be set in files that were compiled via a symbolic link.\n<p>\n\n<b> Source window </b>\n\n<p>\nAdded right-click context menu to line number display.\n<p>\nCtrl-click on a line number resets the point of execution to that line number.\n<p>\nIf text is selected, \\\"Open this file in editor\\\" opens the file to the selection, not to the current point of execution.\n<p>\nAdded Drag-and-Drop source to the left of the file name.  Double clicking on the icon displays the file in the file manager of your choice.\n<p>\nRemoved Line button since it was only wasting space.  Use the",
" item on the Edit menu instead.\n<p>\n\\\"Current line\\\" marker is now consistently removed when the program is running.\n<p>\nAutomatically displays new contents of file when program is reloaded.\n\n<b> Files window </b>\n\n<p>\nUpdates when core file is loaded or gdb attaches to a process.\n<p>\nFixed bug so it now can find header files that do not contain inline code.\n<p>\n\n<b> Variables and Array windows </b>\n\n<p>\nUpdates displayed value when \\\"set\\\" is used on command line to change values.\n<p>\nEdit menu works with selected items.\n<p>\nUnsigned integers can be displayed in base 2, 8, 10, or 16.\n<p>\nImproved robustness of the parser so it is much less likely to get confused and have to resort to displaying the raw output from gdb.\n<p>\nWhen debugging C++ code, <tt>this</tt> is displayed in the Local Variables window.\n<p>\nAdded \\\"Display as 1D array\\\" menu item to Actions menu in Array windows.\n<p>\nUpdating of displayed values is much faster.\n<p>\n\n<b> Miscellaneous </b>\n\n<p>\nAdded \\\"Mac/Win/X emulation...\\\" item to Preferences menu to provide option to choose between Macintosh and Windows style menu shortcuts.  (This assumes that you have not changed Meta to Ctrl in the menu_strings file.)\n<p>\nRenamed \\\"Restart gdb\\\" item to \\\"Restart debugger\\\" and moved it to Debug menu.\n<p>\nMerged \\\"Change gdb binary...\\\" item on File menu into \\\"Preferences...\\\" item on Preferences menu.  You can now specify an entire command instead of merely choosing a binary.\n<p>\nAdded Windows menu to all menu bars.  The list of open source files is alphabetized to make it useful.\n<p>\nTab completion works in all path and file name input fields.\n<p>\nYou can change the menu font by creating <tt>~/.jx/menu_font</tt>.  The first line in the file must be the font name.  The second line in the file must be the font size.\n<p>\nOptimized all windows so they only update if they are visible and not iconified.\n<p>\nFixed bug in Stack window so Help menu works.\n<p>\nFixed bug i",
"n connection to gdb to avoid locking up in obscure cases.\n<p>\nRemoved \\\"Close\\\" button from menu bars since all reasonable window managers provide their own Close button in the title bar.\n<p>\n\n<h3> 1.1.3 </h3>\n\nFixed bug so Meta key works correctly on Mandrake Linux.\n\n<h3> 1.1.2 </h3>\n\nFixed bug so Ctrl-K in command line input area won't cause crash if text is selected.\n\n<h3> 1.1.1 </h3>\n\nFixed bug so closing source windows no longer causes a crash later on.\n\n<h3> 1.1.0 </h3>\n\n<p>\n<b> Major changes </b>\n<p>\nYou can now define your own debug commands.  They are displayed on the bottom of the Debug menu.  These commands can be placed in the toolbar.\n<p>\nAdded Functions menu that lists all of the functions defined in the current source file.  This requires <a href=http://ctags.sourceforge.net/> Exuberant <tt>ctags</tt></a> version 5.0.\n<p>\nAdded a configurable button toolbar.\n<p>\nAdded <tt>-b</tt> command line option to allow setting breakpoints without having to open the source file in a window.  Check the Code Crusader on-line help for information on how to use this feature effectively.\n<p>\nAll of the Code Crusader editor preferences are now honored, so once you set up Code Crusader the way you want it, Code Medic will look the same.  This is especially important for syntax highlighting.\n<p>\n\n<b> Debugging commands </b>\n\n<p>\nAdded \\\"Reload binary\\\" to Debug menu.\n<p>\nCtrl-C and Meta-period are both shortcuts for \\\"Pause execution.\\\"  This keeps both Windows and Macintosh users happy.\n<p>\n\n<b> Source window </b>\n\n<p>\nAdded \\\"Balance closest grouping symbols\\\" and \\\"Go to line...\\\" to Search menu.\n<p>\nMoved \\\"Find current line\\\" from File menu to Search menu.  For consistency with \\\"Go to line...\\\", renamed it to \\\"Go to current line\\\" and changed the shortcut to Meta-&lt;.\n<p>\nMiddle-double-click is now a shortcut to display a variable in the Variables window.  This is faster than \\\"double click, Meta-D\\\".\n<p>\n\n<b> Miscel",
"laneous </b>\n\n<p>\nDramatically reduced startup time by eliminating need to verify the existence of all source files.\n<p>\nFixed hierarchical menus.  It now stays open as long as you are moving the mouse towards it, regardless of what the mouse passes over on the way.\n<p>\nAdded icons for all singleton windows.\n<p>\nRemoved \\\"Save window size\\\" item from all singleton windows.  They now simply remember their last position without having to be told.\n<p>\nFixed <a href=jxhelp:CMVarTreeHelp#Array1D>Array</a> window so \\\"Save window size\\\" saves preference for itself, not for <a href=jxhelp:CMVarTreeHelp>Variables</a> window.\n<p>\nVariables, Stack Trace, etc. no longer close when you close the Command Line window.\n\n</html>\"\nDefCmdGitAddText::CBCommandManager \"Git add file (to index)\"\nNoRestoreFileOwnerError::JXFileDocument \"The file ownership could not be preserved because:\n\n$err\"\nChangeButtonLabel::CMAboutDialog \"Changes\"\nobj5_JXLayout::JXPTPageSetupDialog::JXLayout \"lines\"\nshowHiddenCB::JXSaveFileDialog::JXLayout \"Show hidden files\"\nitsPrintLineNumbersCB::JXPTPrintSetupDialog::JXLayout \"Print line numbers\"\nJFileSystemReadOnly \"You cannot write to a read-only file system.\"\nobj2::JXEditHelpPrefsDialog::JXLayout \"Shell cmd to view URL:\"\nobj1_JXLayout::JXChooseColorDialog::JXLayout \"Sample:\"\nDefCmdSetBreakpointText::CBCommandManager \"Set breakpoint in debugger\"\nHint::JXPathInput \"Either type in a path (tab completion is supported) or Drag-and-Drop a directory.\"\nitsShowXErrorsCB::JX2DCurveOptionsDialog::JXLayout \"Show X Errors\"\nJDescriptorNotOpen \"At least one of the file descriptors does not refer to an open file.\"\nNoBackupDirWriteProtectError::JXFileDocument \"A backup file could not be created because the directory is not writable.\n\nDo you still want to save the file?\"\nWindowTitlePrefixMainSrc::CMSourceDirector \" Current Source - \"\nitsReplaceIsRegexCB::JXSearchTextDialog::shortcuts::JXLayout \"#X\"\ncancelButton::JXChoosePathDialog::JXLayout ",

The syntax is much simpler than for searching.  Every\ncharacter other than backslash (\\\\) and dollar ($) acts the same as before.\n\n<p>\n\nWhen a backslash is followed by one of the following characters, it is\ntranslated just like in the search pattern:\n\n<p>\n<tt>\\\\\\\\</tt> -> backslash <br>\n<tt>\\\\$</tt> -> dollar <br>\n<tt>\\\\t</tt> -> horizontal tab <br>\n<tt>\\\\n</tt> -> newline\n\n<p>\n\nWhen a dollar is followed by a positive integer N, this is converted into\nthe string that the Nth pair of parentheses in the search string matched.\n$0 represents the entire match, even if it was not enclosed in parentheses.\nAs an example:\n\n<blockquote>\n<dl>\n<dt> <tt>ab(c[ef])gh</tt>\n<dd> This can match <tt>abcegh</tt> and <tt>abcfgh</tt>.\n<p>\n<dt> <tt>wx$1yz</tt>\n<dd> This converts the above matches as follows:\n<p>\n		<tt>abcegh",
"</tt> -> <tt>wxceyz</tt>\n<br>\n		<tt>abcfgh</tt> -> <tt>wxcfyz</tt>\n</dl>\n</blockquote>\n\nWhen a dollar is followed by a name in curly braces, this is converted into\nthe string that the named pair of parentheses in the search string matched.\nAs an example:\n\n<blockquote>\n<dl>\n<dt> <tt>ab(?P&lt;x&gt;c[ef])gh</tt>\n<dd> This can match <tt>abcegh</tt> and <tt>abcfgh</tt>.\n<p>\n<dt> <tt>wx${x}yz</tt>\n<dd> This converts the above matches as follows:\n<p>\n		<tt>abcegh</tt> -> <tt>wxceyz</tt>\n<br>\n		<tt>abcfgh</tt> -> <tt>wxcfyz</tt>\n</dl>\n</blockquote>\n\nWithout named parentheses, complicated regex's with nested parentheses can\nmake it very difficult to determine the correct value of N.  There are\ntwo features that alleviate this problem.\n\n<p>\n\nIf the opening parenthesis is followed by <tt>?:</tt>, then the contents\nare not counted when determining N.  As an example, if the regex is\n<tt>((?:red|white) (king|queen))</tt>, then the replacement pattern\n<tt>$2</tt> will produce \\\"king\\\" or \\\"queen\\\" rather than \\\"red\\\" or\n\\\"white.\\\"\n\n<p>\n\nFor the hackers out there, you can also use negative integers after a\ndollar.  $-1 is converted into the string that the <em>last</em> pair of\nparentheses in the search string matched, $-2 is converted into the string\nthat the next to last pair of parentheses in the search string matched,\netc. This can be useful if you want to count from the end of the string.\n\n<h3> For the experts... </h3>\n\nThe best book on the subject is:\n\n<blockquote>\n<cite><a href=http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/regex/desc.html>\nMastering Regular Expressions</a></cite>, by\n<a href=http://enterprise.ic.gc.ca/~jfriedl/regex/>Jeffrey Friedl</a>,\nO'Reilly, 1997.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe Perl and PCRE man pages are the final authority on how Code Crusader's regular\nexpressions behave.  Therein are described many features which are too\ncomplicated and/or obscure to be included here, e.g., lookahead and\nlookbehind assertions, conditional subpatterns, and sub",
"pattern recursion.\n\n<p>\n<b> Matching ambiguities </b> (the longest of the leftmost)\n<p>\n\nIt is easy to write a regular expression that can match a given string in\nmany ways at many positions.  The rule that avoids such ambiguities is that\nthe match that starts closest to the beginning of the string wins.

It was designed to work with <a href=http://www.newplanetsoftware.com/jcc/>Code Crusader</a> but can also be used alone. \n\n<h3> Running Code Medic </h3>\n\nWhen invoking Code Medic, you can include as arguments the program to be debugged, the core file (if any) to debug, and any source files that you want to display, in that order.  The formats for specifying source files are the following:\n\n<ul>\n<li> -f file_name\n<p>\n<li> -f +line_number file_name\n<p>\n<li> -f file_name<b>:</b>line_number\n<p>\n</ul>\n\n<h3> Selecting the underlying debugger </h3>\n\nTo set which underlying debugger to use, select from the first group of menu items on the Preferences menu.\n\n<h3> Selecting the program to debug </h3>\n\n<h4> gdb </h4>\n\nIf you did not specify a program to debug as an argument to Code Medic, you must select one by using the \\\"Choose program...\\\" item on the Debug menu in either the <a href=jxhelp:CMCommandDirHelp>Command Line</a> ",
"window or any <a href=jxhelp:CMSourceWindowHelp>Source View</a> window.  After loading the program into gdb, Code Medic will fill the <a href=jxhelp:CMSourceWindowHelp#FileList>Files</a> window with all the source files used by the program.  It will then display the function <tt>main()</tt> in the <a href=jxhelp:CMSourceWindowHelp>Current Source View</a> window.\n<p>\nBy default, Code Medic uses the version of gdb that is on your execution path.  You can run a different version of gdb by using the \\\"Preferences...\\\" item on the Preferences menu.\n\n<h4> Java </h4>\n\nIn Java, the program to run is specified as a command line argument to the JVM, and the JVM does not know where the source files are.  Choosing a program therefore means selecting a <a href=jxhelp:CMJavaConfigFileHelp>configuration file</a> that defines everything needed for debugging.\n<p>\nIf you did not specify a configuration file as an argument to Code Medic, you must select one by using the \\\"Choose program...\\\" item on the Debug menu in either the <a href=jxhelp:CMCommandDirHelp>Command Line</a> window or any <a href=jxhelp:CMSourceWindowHelp>Source View</a> window.\n<p>\nAfter you choose a program, you can either run it from within Code Medic or you can start it yourself with the <code>-agentlib:jdwp</code> option.  More information on this is available <a href=http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/jpda/conninv.html#Invocation>here</a>.\n<p>\nAfter you start the program, Code Medic will fill the <a href=jxhelp:CMSourceWindowHelp#FileList>Files</a> window with all the source files used by the program.  It will then display the class that defines <tt>main()</tt> in the <a href=jxhelp:CMSourceWindowHelp>Current Source View</a> window, if the source is available.\n<p>\nBy default, Code Medic uses the version of the JVM that is on your execution path.  You can run a different version by using the \\\"Preferences...\\\" item on the Preferences menu.  If you include either <code>-agentlib:jdwp</code> or <code>-Xrunjdwp</",
"code> as part of the command, this will override the default.  If you configure it yourself, you must include <code>transport=dt_socket,address=localhost:9001</code> in order to connect to Code Medic.\n\n<h4> Xdebug </h4>\n\nXdebug uses a remote debugging protocol, so you cannot run the program from within Code Medic.  Instead, you must start your program with instructions to connect to port 9000 of the computer on which Code Medic is running.  More information on this is available <a href=http://www.xdebug.org/docs/remote>here</a>.\n<p>\nChoosing a program means selecting a <a href=jxhelp:CMXdebugConfigFileHelp>configuration file</a> that defines everything needed for debugging.  You do not have to load a configuration file, but it makes it easier to open the program's source files.\n\n<h3> Examining the state of the program </h3>\n\nTo display the value of a variable or expression when your program is paused at a <a href=jxhelp:CMBreakpointsHelp>breakpoint</a>, select the variable name or expression in a <a href=jxhelp:CMSourceWindowHelp>Source View</a> window and then use the \\\"Display variable\\\" item on the Debug menu.  This will open the <a href=jxhelp:CMVarTreeHelp>Variables</a> window and display the result.\n<p>\nTo display the current execution stack when your program is paused at a <a href=jxhelp:CMBreakpointsHelp>breakpoint</a>, open the <a href=jxhelp:CMStackHelp>Stack Trace</a> window.  (You can also pause your program by using the \\\"Pause execution\\\" item on the Debug menu.)\n\n<h3> Debugging a core file </h3>\n\nOnce a program is loaded when using gdb, you may load a core file by using the \\\"Choose core...\\\" item on the Debug menu in either the <a href=jxhelp:CMCommandDirHelp>Command Line</a> window or any <a href=jxhelp:CMSourceWindowHelp>Source View</a> window.  Once the core file has been loaded, the <a href=jxhelp:CMStackHelp>Stack Trace</a> window will automatically be opened to show you the state of the program when it crashed and to allow you to navigate through the execu",
"tion stack to perform the post mortem.\n\n<h3> Debugging a running program </h3>\n\nOnce a program is loaded when using gdb, you may debug a running copy of the program by using the \\\"Choose process...\\\" item on the Debug menu in either the <a href=jxhelp:CMCommandDirHelp>Command Line</a> window or any <a href=jxhelp:CMSourceWindowHelp>Source View</a> window.  Code Medic will pause the process and display the <a href=jxhelp:CMStackHelp>Stack Trace</a> window to show you the current state of the program.\n\n</html>\"\nWizardExecError::CBProjectDocument \"Unable to run the project wizard because:\n\n$err\"\ncancelButton::JXChooseFontSizeDialog::JXLayout \"Cancel\"\ncancelButton::JX2DPlotRangeDialog::shortcuts::JXLayout \"^[\"\nRangeMinColTitle::CMPlot2DExprTable \"Start\"\nTryChangeWriteProtect::JXFileDocument \"The file is write protected.
