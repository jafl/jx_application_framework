When a program that uses threads is paused, the Threads window displays the list of threads that are currently executing.  You can switch between the threads by clicking on the items in the list or by using the up and down arrow keys to move by one thread at a time.  The execution stack for the currently selected thread is displayed in the <a href=jxhelp:CMStackHelp>Stack Trace</a> window.
<p>
To open a <a href=jxhelp:CMSourceWindowHelp>Source View</a> window for a particular thread, hold down the Meta key and click on the item in the list.
