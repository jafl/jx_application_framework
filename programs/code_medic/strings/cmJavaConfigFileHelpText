<title>Java Configuration File</title>
</head>

In Java, the program to run is specified as a command line argument to the JVM, and the JVM does not know where the source files are.  Choosing a program therefore means selecting a configuration file that defines everything needed for debugging.  This configuration file is a simple text file with one configuration key-value pair on each line.

<p>
The first line of the file must be: <code>code-medic: java</code>
<p>
After that, the possible configurations are:

<dl>
<dt> main-class
<dd> The full package + name of the class that defined <code>main</code>, e.g., <code>com.test.HelloWorld</code>.  <q>main-class</q> is only required when Code Medic starts the JVM.
<p>
<dt> java-path
<dd> The directory in which to execute <code>java</code>.  If not specified, it defaults to the directory containing the configuration file.  <q>java-path</q> is only required when Code Medic starts the JVM.
<p>
<dt> java-exec
<dd> The arguments to pass to <code>java</code> which specify which program to run.  (The arguments to <code>main</code> are specified at the bottom of the <a href=jxhelp:CMCommandDirHelp>Command Line window</a>.)  If not specified, it defaults to the value of <q>main-class</q>.  Normally, you only need to specify <q>java-exec</q> if you need to use Java's <code>-jar</code> option.  However, you can also use it to specify a custom <code>-agentlib:jdwp</code> configuration.  <q>java-exec</q> is only used when Code Medic starts the JVM.
<p>
<dt> source-path
<dd> A directory containing the root of a class heirarchy, e.g., the directory that contains <code>com/test/HelloWorld.java</code>.  This can be repeated with each line defining a different directory.  Directories can be relative to the location of the config file.
<p>
<dt> source-jar
<dd> A jar file containing Java source files.  This can be repeated with each line defining a different jar file.  Jar file paths can be relative to the location of the config file.
</dl>
