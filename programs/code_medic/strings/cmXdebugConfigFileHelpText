<title>Xdebug Configuration File</title>
</head>

Choosing a program in Xdebug means selecting a configuration file that defines everything needed for debugging.  This configuration file is a simple text file with one configuration key-value pair on each line.

<p>
The first line of the file must be: <code>code-medic: php</code>
<p>
After that, the possible configurations are:

<dl>
<dt> source-path
<dd> The root of a directory tree containing source files.  This can be repeated with each line defining a different directory.  Directories can be relative to the location of the config file.
</dl>
