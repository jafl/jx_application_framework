<p>
<b> Major changes </b>
<p>
You can now define your own debug commands.  They are displayed on the bottom of the Debug menu.  These commands can be placed in the toolbar.
<p>
Added Functions menu that lists all of the functions defined in the current source file.  This requires <a href=http://ctags.sourceforge.net/> Exuberant <tt>ctags</tt></a> version 5.0.
<p>
Added a configurable button toolbar.
<p>
Added <tt>-b</tt> command line option to allow setting breakpoints without having to open the source file in a window.  Check the Code Crusader on-line help for information on how to use this feature effectively.
<p>
All of the Code Crusader editor preferences are now honored, so once you set up Code Crusader the way you want it, Code Medic will look the same.  This is especially important for syntax highlighting.
<p>

<b> Debugging commands </b>

<p>
Added \"Reload binary\" to Debug menu.
<p>
Ctrl-C and Meta-period are both shortcuts for \"Pause execution.\"  This keeps both Windows and Macintosh users happy.
<p>

<b> Source window </b>

<p>
Added \"Balance closest grouping symbols\" and \"Go to line...\" to Search menu.
<p>
Moved \"Find current line\" from File menu to Search menu.  For consistency with \"Go to line...\", renamed it to \"Go to current line\" and changed the shortcut to Meta-&lt;.
<p>
Middle-double-click is now a shortcut to display a variable in the Variables window.  This is faster than \"double click, Meta-D\".
<p>

<b> Miscellaneous </b>

<p>
Dramatically reduced startup time by eliminating need to verify the existence of all source files.
<p>
Fixed hierarchical menus.  It now stays open as long as you are moving the mouse towards it, regardless of what the mouse passes over on the way.
<p>
Added icons for all singleton windows.
<p>
Removed \"Save window size\" item from all singleton windows.  They now simply remember their last position without having to be told.
<p>
Fixed <a href=jxhelp:CMVarTreeHelp#Array1D>Array</a> window so \"Save window size\" saves preference for itself, not for <a href=jxhelp:CMVarTreeHelp>Variables</a> window.
<p>
Variables, Stack Trace, etc. no longer close when you close the Command Line window.
