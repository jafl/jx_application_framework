<h3>Preferences</h3>

The Integration dialog lets you configure:

<ul>
<li> The command to use for viewing the output of <code>svn diff</code>
<li> The command to execute after Subversion has modified files
</ul>

The default is to use Code Crusader, which provides a graphical view of the difference between revisions.  If you choose the \"Command Line\" option, diffs will be displayed by opening a terminal.  If you use a different IDE, select \"Custom\" and enter the commands required to interface with your IDE.

<hr>

The Configure Toolbar dialog lets you choose which menu items to display as buttons below the menu bar.

<hr>

The File Bindings dialog allows you to configure which program to use for viewing different types of files.  Click the Help button in the dialog for more information.

<hr>

The Web Browser Preferences dialog is primarily useful for specifying the command to use to open a file manager window.  The default is <a href=http://newplanetsoftware.com/systemg/>systemg</a>.  On OS X, <a href=http://yost.com/computers/MacStuff/reveal/index.html>this script</a> will display the file in the Finder.

<hr>

Macintosh/Windows/X preferences provides some miscellaneous preferences for adjusting the program's behavior.

<hr>

\"Save window setup as default\" stores the position and size of the window, so new windows will open in the same location and have the same size.
