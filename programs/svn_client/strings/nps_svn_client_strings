$copyright

This X application provides a simple interface for performing common
subversion tasks, e.g., updating from the repository and checking in to the
repository.

Because this program fully supports the Multiple Document concept,
it can be safely invoked from the command line or via a file manager
as often as you like.

Usage:  nps_svn_client [options] (path|url[@rev])

--help           prints this help
--version        prints version information
--status         path : display 'svn status' for the specified working copy
--refresh-repo   url  : update repo tab for specified url, if open
--refresh-status path : update status tab for specified working copy, if open
--update         path : update specified working copy
--info-log       file : display info & log for specified file
--proplist       file : display properties for specified file"
