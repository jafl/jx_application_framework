"fy the programmer.\"\nJXSearchTextHelp \"<html>\n<head>\n<title> Search & Replace </title>\n</head>\n\n<h4> Experts will more likely be interested in\n<a href=jxhelp:JXRegexHelp>Regular Expressions</a> </h4>\n\nThe text that will be affected is the text input area that was clicked or typed in last.  The dialog is resizable, and the position and size are remembered.\n\n<h3> Searching for text </h3>\n\nEnter the text for which to search in the \\\"Search for\\\" input area.  The right \\\"Find\\\"\nbutton searches for the next match and selects it, while the left \\\"Find\\\" button\nsearches for the previous match.\n<p>\nIf \\\"Ignore case\\\" is checked, the search will not be case-sensitive.\nIf \\\"Wrap search\\\" is checked, the search will wrap around if it hits the\nbeginning or end of the text and will continue from the end or the beginning,\nrespectively.  If \\\"Entire words only\\\" is checked and the search text is also\nentire words (e.g. \\\"hello\\\" or \\\"hi there\\\", but not \\\"this?\\\"), the search\nwill ignore matches that are part of other words.  As an example, \\\"and\\\" will\nnot match \\\"sand\\\".\n<p>\nIf \\\"Regex search (egrep)\\\" is checked, the search text will be interpreted as a\n<a href=jxhelp:JXRegexHelp>regular expression</a>.  The \\\"Ref\\\" button displays a\nshort reference summary of regular expression syntax.  If \\\"Treat as single line\\\"\nis checked, the regex will be allowed to match across multiple lines.  Otherwise,\neach match will only be allowed to extend until it reaches a newline character.\n<p>\nClicking on the down arrow next to the \\\"Search for\\\" input area displays a menu\nof the last 20 search patterns.  Selecting one copies it to the input area.\n<p>\nThe right \\\"Find\\\" button has the shortcuts Return and Meta-G.  The left \\\"Find\\\"\nbutton has the shortcuts Shift-Return and Meta-Shift-G.  The latter shortcuts are\nthe same as in the Text Editor window.\n\n<h3> Replacing text </h3>\n\nEnter the text with which to replace the current",
"ly selected match in the\n\\\"Replace with\\\" input area.  The \\\"Replace\\\" button replaces the selected text if it\nmatches the current search text.  The \\\"Replace & Find\\\" buttons do the same and\nthen search for and select the next or previous match.  If \\\"Wrap search\\\" is\nchecked, the \\\"Replace all\\\" buttons search for all matches in the specified direction\nstarting from the beginning or end of the text and replace each one.  Otherwise, they\nsearch for all matches starting from the current caret position or selection and\nreplace each one, stopping at the beginning or end of the text.\n<p>\nIf \\\"Regex replace\\\" is checked, the replace pattern will be interpreted as a\n<a href=jxhelp:JXRegexHelp#Replace>regular expression</a>.  Note that the shortcut\nfor toggling this checkbox is Meta-Shift-X, because Meta-X is the shortcut for\n\\\"Regex search.\\\"\n<p>\nIf \\\"Preserve case\\\" is checked, the case of the replace text will be adjusted to\nmatch that of the matched search text, when possible.  This is primarily useful\nwhen performing a case-insensitive search.  The rules for when the case is adjusted\nare as follows:\n\n<ol>\n<li> If the texts have the same length, the case of each character is adjusted\n     separately.  For example, matching \\\"aBc\\\" and replacing with \\\"xyz\\\" produces\n     \\\"xYz\\\".\n<p>\n<li> Otherwise, the first letter's case is adjusted, and then the rest of\n     the letters' cases are adjusted if all but the first letter in the matched\n     text have the same case.  For example, matching \\\"aBC\\\" and replacing with\n     \\\"wxyz\\\" produces \\\"wXYZ\\\", while matching \\\"AbC\\\" produces \\\"Wxyz\\\".\n</ol>\n\nClicking on the down arrow next to the \\\"Replace with\\\" input area displays a menu\nof the last 20 replace patterns.  Selecting one copies it to the input area.\n<p>\nThe \\\"Replace\\\" button has the shortcut Meta-=.  The right \\\"Replace & Find\\\"\nbutton has the shortcut Meta-L.  The left \\\"Replace & Find\\\" butt",
"on has the\nshortcut Meta-Shift-L.  These are the same shortcuts as in the Text Editor window.\n\n<h3> Sharing search parameters between programs </h3>\n\nSince many programs allow you to search through text, this program has been designed to allow the search parameters to be automatically shared with other programs via the <a href=http://www.newplanetsoftware.com/xsearch/>XSearch protocol</a>.  The advantage of this is that you can use the \\\"Enter search string\\\" menu item in one program, the \\\"Enter replace string\\\" menu item in a second program, and then search and replace in a third program without ever having to use the clipboard to transfer any of the text.  All the other options in the Search Text dialog are also shared, so you can configure a search in one program and then use it in any other program that supports the protocol.\n\n</html>\"\nitsUseSmallButtonsCB::JXToolBarEditDir::JXLayout \"Use small buttons\"\nDOWNLOAD_URL \"http://newplanetsoftware.com/nps/downloads.php\"\nitsNextTipButton::JXTipOfTheDayDialog::JXLayout \"Next tip\"\nitsIgnoreCaseCB::JXSearchTextDialog::shortcuts::JXLayout \"#I\"\nAssertUnsavedFilePrefix::JXFileDocument \"##untitled##_\"\nJDirEntryAlreadyExists \"\\\"$name\\\" already exists.\"\nCopyDescription::JXTEBase \"copy the text\"\nStatusTerminated::jProcessUtil \"Program terminated by $signal\"\nfilterLabel::JXChoosePathDialog::JXLayout \"Filter:\"\nobj1_JXLayout::JXToolBarEditDir::JXLayout \"Check off the menu items below that you want to appear on the toolbar.\"\npathLabel::JXChooseFileDialog::JXLayout \"Path:\"\nitsReplaceAllInSelButton::JXSearchTextDialog::JXLayout \"Replace all in selection\"\nitsCloseButton::JXPGMessageDirector::JXLayout \"Close\"\nStatusSuccess::jProcessUtil \"Program finished successfully\"\nobj4_JXLayout::JXSearchTextDialog::JXLayout \"Replace & Find\"\nobj1_JXLayout::JXGoToLineDialog::JXLayout \"Goto line:\"\nobj3_JXLayout::JXEditWWWPrefsDialog::JXLayout \"Shell cmd to compose mail:\"\nHint::JXDirectSaveSource \"Drag this to an XDS co",

By using the options for elasticity on the right-click menu for any pane separator, you can specify that only one pane in a group should expand or shrink.  Typically, this is the pane that contains the windows that you work with the most.\n<p>\nTo specify that a particular type of window should always be placed in a particular pane, dock a window of the desired type in that pane, right-click on the vertical bar to the left of the menu bar in the newly docked window, and selec",

This also works for backslash itself,\nso \\\\\\\\ matches a single backslash.\n<p>\nNote that since Perl regular expressions are incredibly powerful, this section only provides a summary of the most useful options.\n\n<dl>\n<dt> <b> Matching characters </b>\n<p>\n\n<dt> <tt>.</tt> (period)\n<dd> Matches any single character.\n<dd> <tt>a.c</tt> can match <tt>abc</tt> or <tt>axc</tt> but not <tt>axyc</tt>.\n\n<p>\n<dt> <tt>[ ]</tt> (square brackets)\n<dd> This defines a \\\"character class\\\" and matches any single character out of the\n     characters listed between the brackets (e.g. <tt>[abc]</tt> can match any one of\n     <tt>a</tt>, <tt>b</tt>, or <tt>c</tt>), with the exception of the following:\n	<p>\n	<dl>\n	<dt> <tt>-</tt> (dash)\n	<dd> The most common use of character classes is to specify ranges of characters\n	     <em>in the ASCII table</em> by using a dash, as in <tt>[0-9]</tt>, which can\n	     match any character between 0 and 9.  Note that, since it is based on the ASCII table,\n	     <tt>[A-z]</tt> will match A through Z, [, \\\\, ], ^, _, `, and a through z.

The syntax is much simpler than for searching.  Every\ncharacter other than backslash (\\\\) and dollar ($) acts the same as before.\n\n<p>\n\nWhen a backslash is followed by one of the following characters, it is\ntranslated just like in the search pattern:\n\n<p>\n<tt>\\\\\\\\</tt> -> backslash <br>\n<tt>\\\\$</tt> -> dollar <br>\n<tt>\\\\t</tt> -> horizontal tab <br>\n<tt>\\\\n</tt> -> newline\n\n<p>\n\nWhen a dollar is followed by a positive integer N, this is converted into\nthe string that the Nth pair of parentheses in the search string matched.\n$0 represents the entire match, even if it was not enclosed in parentheses.\nAs an example:\n\n<blockquote>\n<dl>\n<dt> <tt>ab(c[ef])gh</tt>\n<dd> This can match <tt>abcegh</tt> and <tt>abcfgh</tt>.\n<p>\n<dt> <tt>wx$1yz</tt>\n<dd> This converts the above matches as follows:\n<p>\n		<tt>abcegh</tt> -> <tt>wxceyz</tt>\n<br>\n		<tt>abcfgh</tt> -> <tt>wxcfyz</tt>\n</dl>\n</blockquote>\n\nWhen a dollar is followed by a name in curly braces, this is converted into\nthe string that the named pair of parentheses in the search string matched.\nAs an example:\n\n<blockquote>\n<dl>\n<dt> <tt>ab(?P&lt;x&gt;c[ef])gh</tt>\n<dd> This can match <tt>abcegh</tt> and <tt>abcfgh</tt>.\n<p>\n<dt> <tt>wx${x}yz</tt>\n<dd> This converts the above matches as follows:\n<p>\n		<tt>abcegh</tt> -> <tt>wxceyz</tt>\n<br>\n		<tt>abcfgh</tt> -> <tt>wxcfyz</tt>\n</dl>\n</blockquote>\n\nWithout named parentheses, complicated regex's with nested parentheses can\nmake it very difficult to determine the correct value of N. ",
" There are\ntwo features that alleviate this problem.\n\n<p>\n\nIf the opening parenthesis is followed by <tt>?:</tt>, then the contents\nare not counted when determining N.  As an example, if the regex is\n<tt>((?:red|white) (king|queen))</tt>, then the replacement pattern\n<tt>$2</tt> will produce \\\"king\\\" or \\\"queen\\\" rather than \\\"red\\\" or\n\\\"white.\\\"\n\n<p>\n\nFor the hackers out there, you can also use negative integers after a\ndollar.  $-1 is converted into the string that the <em>last</em> pair of\nparentheses in the search string matched, $-2 is converted into the string\nthat the next to last pair of parentheses in the search string matched,\netc. This can be useful if you want to count from the end of the string.\n\n<h3> For the experts... </h3>\n\nThe best book on the subject is:\n\n<blockquote>\n<cite><a href=http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/regex/desc.html>\nMastering Regular Expressions</a></cite>, by\n<a href=http://enterprise.ic.gc.ca/~jfriedl/regex/>Jeffrey Friedl</a>,\nO'Reilly, 1997.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe Perl and PCRE man pages are the final authority on how Code Crusader's regular\nexpressions behave.  Therein are described many features which are too\ncomplicated and/or obscure to be included here, e.g., lookahead and\nlookbehind assertions, conditional subpatterns, and subpattern recursion.\n\n<p>\n<b> Matching ambiguities </b> (the longest of the leftmost)\n<p>\n\nIt is easy to write a regular expression that can match a given string in\nmany ways at many positions.  The rule that avoids such ambiguities is that\nthe match that starts closest to the beginning of the string wins.  If more\nthan one match is possible at this position, the longest possible match\nwins, unless you explicitly use the <tt>?</tt> modifier to make a\nquantifier non-greedy.\n\n<p>\n<b> Operator precedence </b>\n<p>\n\nWhen more than one operator can apply to a subexpression, they are applied\nin the following order of precedence:\n\n<pre>\n    (highest precedence, applied first)\n\n    () []",
" ^ $ \\\\\n    * + ? {,}\n    catenation\n    |\n\n    (lowest precedence, applied last)\n</pre>\n\nAs an example, <tt>a|b*</tt> is equivalent to <tt>(a)|(b*)</tt> and matches a\nsingle <tt>a</tt> or any number of <tt>b</tt>'s rather than being equivalent to\n<tt>(a|b)*</tt> and matching any number of consecutive <tt>a</tt>'s and <tt>b</tt>'s.\n\n</html>\"\nEmptyComposeRuleList::JXHelpManager \"<html>\n<head><title> Special key sequences </title></head>\n<body> No special key sequences have been defined. </body>\n</html>\"\nitsChooseFileButton::JXPTPrintSetupDialog::shortcuts::JXLayout \"#O\"\nitsCloseButton::JXSearchTextDialog::shortcuts::JXLayout \"#W^[\"\nsaveButton::JXSaveFileDialog::shortcuts::JXLayout \"^M\"\nitsCreditsButton::MDAboutDialog::JXLayout \"Credits\"\nMoveDescription::JXTEBase \"move the text\"\nUnreadable::JXPathInput \"This directory is unreadable.\"\nitsScrollCaretCB::JXMacWinPrefsDialog::JXLayout \"Caret follows when you scroll\"\nTriedWriteSaveNewFile::JXFileDocument \"Unable to obtain permission to write to the file.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n<p>\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n<p>\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n<p>\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, w",
"hether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n<p>\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n<p>\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n<p>\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n<p>\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n<p>\n<center>\n<b>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</b>\n<p>\n<b>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</b>\n</center>\n<p>\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \\\"Program\\\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \\\"work based on the Program\\\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \\\"modification\\\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \\\"y",
"ou\\\".\n<p>\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n<p>\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n<p>\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n<p>\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n<p>\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n<p>\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n<p>\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that",
" users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n<p>\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n<p>\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n<p>\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n<p>\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n<p>\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n<p>\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physica",
"lly performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n<p>\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n<p>\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n<p>\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n<p>\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n<p>\n  5. You are not required to ",
"accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n<p>\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n<p>\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n<p>\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n<p>\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infring",
"e any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n<p>\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n<p>\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n<p>\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n<p>\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \\\"any\nlater version\\\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n<p>\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to ",
