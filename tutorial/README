To build these examples, run makemake and then run make.  makemake can be
found in the programs/makemake directory of the JX distribution.

To run the programs, make sure that the jx and jcore libraries are on your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  These libraries will either be installed in standard
system directories or will be found in the "jlib/lib" directory of the JX
distribution.  For instructions on setting environment variables (i.e.
LD_LIBRARY_PATH), please refer to the JX FAQ on the web.

When studying the source code, you will probably find it useful to refer to
the documentation provided with the JX distribution for further information
about the theory of operation.  The details of particular functions are
documented in the JX source code itself.

Once you understand all these tutorials, you are ready to dive into
libjx/test, which contains more complex examples of all the features
provided by JX.
