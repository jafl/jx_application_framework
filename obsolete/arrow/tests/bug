Hello,

     I am having a problem with jcc2.1.4 on FreeBSD 3.x. When I 
mouse-click the Functions menu, jcc locks-up, unable to do anything else. 
When I killall ctags in a terminal, the Functions menu appears and works 
normally until I close the window and open it again. Then it is back to 
the same problem.  The same happens on BSD 3.2 - 3.4. My only guess is 
that the last time that it worked fine, I was using jcc 2.1.3.

     Is there a solution to this problem? And if not, is there some way I 
can get 2.1.3 source again?

     Thanks
