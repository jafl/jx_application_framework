I downloaded your Tester Program from the web. It is very interesting

I am a resident in Radiology and just completed taking our written board
exam. While I was studying, I used our file cabinet that contains "recalled
questions" from previous exams. It appearred that about 20% of the
questions were identical to priors and another 20-30% were very similar,
but worded slightly differently.

I have been thinking about creating a book or cd-rom with recalled test
questions and well research answers.  I found several testbank software
programs on the web and yours seems to be the closest to what I would need.

There are three types of questions on our boards: multiple choice,
true/false and matching. Very few photographs or drawings were included. I
currently have about 750 questions in my word processor and will soon
double that to about 1500.

I have presented my idea to a textbook publisher and he is very interested.
He did however express concerns about copywrite issues, because the
questions are recalled from a copywrited exam. I have also been considering
self-publishing in electronic format.

What do you think of my idea? Do you have any experience with data banks of
practice question?

For now I think I will send you the shareware fee and play around with your
product and see if it fits my needs. I think that to be marketable in
radiology a Windows version woud have to be offered (I love Mac and hate
Windows but a buck's a buck) Is there a windows version availabe? Would it
be difficult (or expensive) to create one.

I am attaching a Word document that is the proposal that I gave to the
medical book publisher.

If I could give you a quick suggestion. I like to print out the
help/instructions because it's easier for me to read. I couldn't figure out
how to print the whole file at once and had to print each subsection
individually which was a little bit tedious.

Thank you for your time and I would appreciate any feedback that you might have.
