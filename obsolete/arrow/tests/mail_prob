If the feature is that important to you, grab a book on python and 
start coding.

I'd like what you want, too. But there are higher priorities on my 
list. It'll get done eventually, I guess. But the joy of open source 
is that you not only can use it, you can improve it.

Oh, and you have a funky definition of spam, IMHO. Mailman isn't 
generating spam. it's doing what it's supposed to do -- tell the 
admin something is there for evaluation. That ain't spam.

Now, what you want mailman to do, which is be smart enough to 
recognize and throw out spam, is a great idea. But it's easier said 
than done. Just ask the guys writing anti-spam code for sendmail and 
the other MTA's (which is, IMHO, where anti-spam stuff ought to be 
anyway. Keep it off the site in the first place)

One of the most difficult things I've done is try to move mailman.

I have several lists which are used internally and need to move to a 
new host.  The question is...what's the best way or tried+true way to 
move mailman around?


Much appreciated,

I've had success with installing mailman on the new machine, moving
"lists/" and "archives/" wholesale, and using bin/move_list if the
home dir has changed (say, from /export/home/mailman to /home/mailman
or some such)

I haven't been following the 2.0 beta bug list lately, and I need some
upgrade advice.

We want to upgrade our Mailman installation to 2.0 for the coming
year.  It's not plain to me that a 2.0 release will be available before
classes resume in mid-September, though, so I'm considering an interim
upgrade to a 2.0 beta now, while our active user count is low, and a
final upgrade to 2.0 later on.

We're running 1.0rc2 now, and don't really want to run another academic
year on pre-release code -- especially not this one -- so an upgrade
seems essential.

Does this seem reasonable to people who've used the 2.0 series so far?
Are there any major problems to watch out for in the current beta
version, such that it would make more sense to wait and do the whole
thing at once -- even if that's *after* school starts and all our users
are back in full swing?  We might settle for 1.1 that's the
overwhelmingly preferred answer, but since 2.0 contains fixes we're
kind of counting on, we'd rather not.

Thanks.

Hi,

I'm new to this list, so I'm not sure if this has already been covered,b
but we have found a problem with mailman in translating Japanese to HTML.

The character string  "!<" gets translated to "!&lt;", which breaks the
Japanese font.

Is there a fix for this?

Thanks,
-Joe Marchak.

I just installed Mailman onto a new Redhat 6.2 system with Python 1.5.2-13 
and Apache 1.3.12. It looks like the mailman install went okay and I setup 
a list. However, when I try to make any changes to the list it will go 
immediately back to the Password screen without making any changes. The 
permissions on my mailman directory are a+rx,g+ws as per the documentation.

Any ideas?

In the "Privacy Options" admin page
(/cgi-bin/mailman/admin/thelist/privacy), change the value of the
following question to "NO":
 . Show member addrs so they're not directly recognizable as email addrs?

This corresponds to "obscure_addresses = 0" from a dump of the config
database.

Okay, well, the fun has begun! 

I'm taking over system admin and I'd like to dump the lame alias file
includes and move to mailman, but I'm having a few small problems.

First of all, I can't seem to figure out how to install the wrapper.  Most
of the docs don't mention OpenBSD (the system that I'm afraid I'm stuck
with) and lots of things are in non-standard places.  For example:

- We run sendmail, but smrsh just a file in /etc/sbin, there is no
directory

- Aliases are in dir /etc/mail, not just /etc/aliases

So the major problem is that sendmail doesn't understand the
"test" mailing list I've set up.  Or at least doesn't know that test and
test-requests are now valid email addys.  The mailman logs seem to be
happy and I only get "unknown user" errors in sendmail logs.

// Other than that, I've always liked being _on_ mailman mailing
// lists.  :-)   Evolution (and all of helixcode's lists) are much
// fun! :-)

Oh, and one other feature/wishlist item:  I am going to have two lists
total, but I'd like to have this sort of setup:  List A can only mail list
A.  List B is only sub'ed to B, but can send mail to both A and
B.  Because "B" is going to be somewhat small and un-changing, I was going
to enter those email exceptions by hand, but it would be nice if this was
some how allowed.
  
Share the day,
Seer

p.s. OpenBSD 2.6, Python 1.5.2, sendmail 8.9.3, most current mailman
(beta)

Aliases are not added to the MTA automatically; you have to add
them by hand (as the "newlist" mail message and output say).

a possible security hole in and of itself)). I'm using exim, which works
*REALLY* well, since it reaches into Mailman's config.db file for aliases.

	You did (I only ask out of completeness) add the appropriate aliases
*and* run newaliases right?

1.x vesion.

If you are using a version of Mailman older than 2.0b5, you
might try updating.  The cookie handling code used for
maintaining the authentication information has been improved.
(Alternatively, you might try using a different web browser,
as at least some of the earlier problems seemed related to
one browser family.)

I've spent about 15 hours in the last two days trying to wind my 
way through the maze I'm dealing with.

First, I have a Redhat 6.2 server running Plesk Server 
Administrator. Plesk creates a fairly secure environment, including 
using suexec for cgi-bin security.

This is giving me fits, since it means I have to give special 
ownership and specific rights to the /home/mailman/cgi-bin 
directory. This means that once I get this directory set so that the 
cgi-bin files will execute that bin/check_perms returns a bunch of 
errors, ie: it thinks that most of it should be owned by mailman 
instead of the suexec group id.

Also, bin/check_perms suggests that the cgi-bin directory should 
be chmod 02775, but suexec insists on 02755. Also, I had to 
chown a lot of files in the /home/mailman directory to the suexec 
id, ie: chown -R fiberhos.pleskcli instead of mailman.mailman.

I'm wondering at this point if I can even get it to work at all...

Am I beating a dead horse?

What do I have so far? If I log into the server at: 
https://www.fiberhosting.com/mailman/admin, I get the admin 
page, but if I try to open 
https://www.fiberhosting.com/mailman/admin/test, it just locks up 
and waits several minutes until it times out. There is nothing written 
to the logs/error file or any other file in the logs directory. the 
suexec log shows that a cgi script ran without problems. There is 
nothing in the apache logs. After it timed out, the python process 
stopped. (ps aux)

I'd really appreciate any help I can get from any of you. Thanks...

Here is some information on the server (from an error I corrected 
during my getting permissions set)

I upgraded a Solaris mailserver to python 1.5.3, which worked fine, 
and then upgraded to mailman 2.0b5.

   I did so by doing a ./configure and then a make install, as per the 
docs, which said to just overwrite the existing directory if going 
from 1.1. to the current version.

Only problem is, mail sent to the list goes -nowhere-.  I know it's 
being accepted by the list server's sendmail process, but what 
happens after that...i have no idea.  It isn't showing up in the 
archives, and it isn't being delivered. Watching the system with top, 
I see nothing that indicates any delivery is going on.

What do I need to check?  This is for a mailing list with 1,500 
people who get really grumpy when they don't get their mail...

Brett

duh.  I searched my mailbox of messages, found a note about needing 
to install a crontab, that mailman handles delivery that way now. 
Duh.


Nevermind :-)

(but beware, I have some questions regarding gaining back the 
performance improvement I saw with the split delivery[ie, dist list 
split into 5 chunks, stuff like that] that 1.1. used to do.)  We have 
a LOT of list members with crappy mail servers, name servers, 
etc...and I can't afford the huge penalty of 1,400 people being hung 
up because some clown at #99 in the list's mail server is down.

I installed 2.0b5 on a new server as I was moving the list management.  I then
proceded to create newlists for each of the old ones.  I followed that up with a
config_list from the old server and used it to modify the new lists.  Lastly, I
pulled all the members from the old lists and added them into the new server's
lists.

However, now when I look at the new server, it shows all the lists as not being
public.  However, if I look individually at them, they are marked as being
public.  They just aren't showing up as a result of the listinfo.cgi run.
HELP???

Hello everyone.

I have a slight problem.  When I create a new list, everything works fine
and the list is created and I can add users and everything.  My problem is
that the name of the machine is not the name that I want the users to use.
For example, right now I get
http://aleph03.mydomain.com/mailman/listinfo/listname I would like that to
read http://listserv.mydomain.com/mailman/listinfo/listname.  Is there an
easy way of doing this or do I have to re install mailman?

Thanks in advance.

I am trying to install mailman and despite python being on the system
(/usr/local/bin/python) it still fails with "No such file or directory:
python". This is happening when I enter "make install". Any idea?

check that you have /usr/local/bin in your $PATH:
$ echo $PATH

if it isn't, try
$ PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
$ export PATH
or:
$ setenf PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
depending on your shell.
