Thank you for registering for the U. S. Postal Service's Internet 
Shipping Application Program Interfaces (APIs).

Attached you will find a copy of the Web Tool Kit User’s Guide, which 
provides documentation and sample code for implementing each of the APIs.  
This document is in PDF format.  In order to open and view this document 
you must have Adobe Acrobat Reader installed on your system.  You can 
download this software, at no cost, from 
www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/readstep.html.

Below are your Username, Password and the URL you will use for testing 
your implementation of the APIs.  These will allow you to begin sending 
calls to the Test Server as soon as you are ready.  When you have completed 
your testing, notify the USPS Internet Customer Care Center (ICCC) listed 
below and they will switch your profile to allow you access to the 
Production Server and provide you with the production URL.

The ICCC is manned from 7:00AM to 11:00PM Eastern Time.

                            IMPORTANT NOTICE
                         REGARDING PASSWORD AND ID

The API "Password Name" and "ID Code" that you have received is for you and 
your company only to use when requesting data via the Internet from the U.S. 
Postal Service API servers.  This unique password name and ID code is not to 
be shared with others outside your organization nor is it to be packaged and 
distributed or sold to other individuals, businesses or e-commerce web site 
entities.  As per the Terms and Conditions of Use Agreement signed during 
the Web Tool Kit (API) registration process:  "User is responsible to maintain 
the confidentiality of its password and ID as specified in the registration 
process.  User may not package any or all shipping APIs with password and ID 
for resale or distribution to others."  The U.S. Postal Service does not mind 
if the API documentation (User’s Guide) with sample code is reused and/or 
distributed in order to generate awareness, encourage use or provide 
ease-of-use to customers or affiliates.

Warning - If the U.S. Postal Service discovers use of the same password 
and ID code from more than one web site, all users will be subject to loss 
of access to the USPS production server and/or termination of the licenses 
granted under the Terms and Conditions of Use.  For more information 
regarding the USPS Web Tool Kit password and ID code policy, or for questions
regarding distribution of documentation, send e-mail to icustomercare@usps.com.
Thank you for helping the U.S. Postal Service provide new Internet services 
to our shipping customers.

Sincerely,

The Internet Shipping Solutions Team
