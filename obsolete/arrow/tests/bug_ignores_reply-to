Hi folks,
Yesterday we released the first alpha version of our commercial email 
client 'Mulberry' for the Unix platform (its already available for Mac OS & 
Win32). Initial OS's supported are Linux x86 (RedHat 5 & 6) and Linux PPC 
2000. Solaris will follow shortly. Mulberry is a standards based IMAP, 
POP3, IMSP, ACAP, LDAP email client with support for multiple 
authentication methods and PGP. With over half a million licensed users its 
proved to be an excellent solution for large sites that have many roaming 
users and kiosk-type lab machines, due in part to the special administrator 
features we have.

For more information on the unis version, please see:

<http://www.cyrusoft.com/mulberry/testers/unix.html>

The Mulberry port for Unix was done using JX and I think provides a good 
example of how JX can be used to create commercial-grade software for Unix 
- hopefully we can encourage more people to use it! We've been very pleased 
with the choice of JX as our framework, and both John & Glenn at New Planet 
Software have been helpful with issues we've had. Porting from MFC (Win32) 
and PowerPlant (Mac OS) frameworks to JX was relatively easy, even 
something as complicated as our preferences dialog, with multiple panels 
within panels, took only about a week and a half to do - though that did 
involce a number of late nights!

We've made a number of minor changes to our own internal JX distribution 
and we're hoping to contribute these back to the 'official' version. There 
are also some extra classes we've created for things such as a 
Windows-style tab panel etc, and these will also be contributed back - 
assuming someone actually wants it! We're also looking at 
internationalisation and localisation issues, which is something we need to 
deal with further down the road.

We still have a way to go to get to final release status, but we're real 
pleased with what we have right now.
