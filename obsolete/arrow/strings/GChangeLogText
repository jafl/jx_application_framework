<h3> 2.0.0 </h3>

<p>
<b>Major changes</b>
<p>

Attachments are now supported. They can be 
<a href=jxhelp:GSendHelp#Attachments>sent</a> 
and <a href=jxhelp:GViewHelp#Attachments>received</a>. Attachments 
can be viewed by double-clicking on them, and they can be saved by 
simply drag-and-dropping them onto any 
<a href=http://www.newplanetsoftware.com/jx/dnd.html>XDND</a> 
compliant file manager (like 
<a href=http://www.newplanetsoftware.com/systemg/>SystemG</a>).
<p>

<a href=jxhelp:GAccountHelp>Multiple accounts</a> are now supported. 
This allows you to maintain several accounts. When a message is received 
from a particular account (via POP) Arrow will remember from which account 
it was received, so the proper settings will be retained when resonding 
to it. The specific preferences available to each account have been somewhat 
modified from the previous version's single account.
<p>

<a href=jxhelp:GFilterHelp>Mail filtering</a> is now supported. 
Mail filters sort your mail as it comes in according to conditions 
that you provide. This feature is extremely useful in managing large 
volumes of e-mail.
<p>

<b>Minor changes</b>
<p>

Added a drag button in the <a href=jxhelp:GViewHelp>message view window</a> 
that lets you drag the current message to the 
<a href=jxhelp:GMailTreeHelp>Mailbox window</a>.
<p>

The reply status of a message is now indicated in the main message window. 
For example, if you reply to a message, the icon corresponding to reply 
will be displayed to the left of the message.
<p>

Creating a new mailbox or directory in the Mailbox window is now more 
straight forward. If you first select a directory, then selecting 
<i>New mailbox</i> or <i>New directory</i> will create the appropriate 
item in that directory and allow you to edit the name. If you first 
select a mailbox, the new mailbox or directory will be created in 
that mailbox's directory.
<p>

Some SMTP bugs were fixed that prevented mail from being sent to some 
servers (namely <a href=www.yahoo.com>Yahoo</a>).
<p>

Fixed an outbox error that wrote partial outbox messages if there was 
an SMTP error.
<p>

Added <a href=jxhelp:GPrefHelp>editor options</a> regarding whether 
or not to copy text when selected, and whether or not the home/end keys 
should move the cursor to the beginning/end of the line.
<p>

Fixed a bug that didn't save all of the window prefs.
<p>

All file locking is now done with <i>lockfile</i>, because of 
NFS and other network issues.
<p>

Fixed a few address book bugs, and changed the shortcut for removing 
items in the addressbook from <i>Meta-R</i> to <i>Backspace</i>.
