<b>Address book overview</b>

<p>

The address book window allows you to keep a record of e-mail addresses, 
and is presented as a list of openable address books containing 
openable entries. These entries are sorted by the actual name, 
organization, or list that owns the addresses, and contain a nickname 
that can be used as a shortcut, an arbitrary number of addresses, 
an optional comment, and an fcc.
All of the values in the list can be edited by clicking on the 
area that you want to edit.

<p>

<b>Adding entries to an address book</b> 

<p>

You can add a new entry to an address book by clicking on an address book 
and selecting <i>New name</i> from the <i>Addresses</i> menu. 
If no address book is selected, an entry will be added to the first 
writable address book. 

<p>

New entries can also be added to an address book by dropping an e-mail 
address on top of an address book.

<p>

<b>Adding addresses to an existing entry</b>

<p>

If you want to add an additional address to an existing entry, click on 
the entry and select <i>New address</i> from the <i>Addresses</i> menu. 
You can also drop and e-mail address on to the entry.

<p>

<b>Adding or creating an address book</b>

<p>

If you want to create a new address book, select <i>New address book</i> 
from the <i>Addresses</i> menu. To add an existing address book to the 
list, select <i>Add address book</i> from the <i>Addresses</i> menu. 

<p>

<b>Deleting or removing an item</b>

<p>

To delete an entry from an address book, or an extra address from an entry, 
or the fcc or comment lines from an entry, select <i>Remove from list</i> 
from the <i>Addresses</i> menu after clicking on the item. 
If an address book is selected, then <i>Remove from list</i> will simply 
remove that address book from the list without deleting it from the 
file system. To actually delete an address book, select 
<i>Delete from file system</i> from the <i>Addresses</i> menu.

<p>

<b>Showing fcc and comment</b>

<p>

Since the fcc and comment lines are optional, they are not added by default. 
To add them to an entry, click on the appropriate entry and select 
<i>Show fcc</i>, or <i>Show comment</i> from the <i>Addresses</i> menu.
