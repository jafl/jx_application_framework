<a name=Intro>
<b>Introduction</b> 
<p> Arrow was designed to be a full-featured, yet easy 
to use mail program. While currently only in its first stable release, 
Arrow still has a great deal of functionality, including secure 
mail via PGP, POP access,  and a spell 
checker. One unique feature of Arrow is its drag-and-drop functionality. 
Messages can be dragged from one mail file and moved to another mail file, 
with each mail file viewed in a separate window. Messages can also be 
rearranged within one mail file by dragging messages around. Another unique 
feature of Arrow is the session. Whenever you quit Arrow, the complete 
state is saved. In other words, it will remember which messages you were 
viewing, which mail files were opened and what messages you were composing. 
It will also remember the window sizes and positions for each window.
<p>
Like some other mail programs, Arrow stores a list of you inboxes. I use 
procmail to filter my mail into several different mail files. Whenever one 
of Arrow's inboxes receives new mail, Arrow will open the mail file in the 
form of an inbox icon on the desktop. This performs the same function then 
that xbiff has in the past, except all you need to do if double-click on 
the icon, and you'll be able to view the mail in that inbox.
<p>
Arrow was designed such that it could be used in conjunction with command 
line mail or Pine. For example, I often need to log in remotely and read my 
mail with only a command line interface. Since arrow leaves the mail files 
in the original format, this is not a problem. I've even used Pine's 
address book format for the address book of Arrow, so that if you use Pine 
and have a large address book, you don't need to do anything to use your 
addresses in Arrow.

<b>Editing</b>
<p>

The editor in Arrow is quite useful thanks to the underlying GUI library, 
JX. For maximum functionality, however, you may need to slightly adjust 
your window manager's configuration. Fvwm and its descendants, for example, 
capture a lot of key combinations that it doesn't really need. Some of 
these can be used by the editor for improved usability. 

<p>
A typical Fvwm, Fvwm2, or Fvwm95 configuration includes the following:
<p>
<pre>
# press arrow + control anywhere, and scroll by 1 page 
Key Left	A	C	Scroll -100 0 
Key Right	A	C	Scroll +100 +0 
Key Up		A	C	Scroll +0   -100 
Key Down	A	C	Scroll +0   +100 

# press arrow + meta key, and scroll by 1/10 of a page 
Key Left	A	M	Scroll -10 +0 
Key Right	A	M	Scroll +10 +0 
Key Up		A	M	Scroll +0   -10 
Key Down	A	M	Scroll +0   +10 
</pre>
<p>

The upper section scrolls your virtual terminal by a page when you type the 
control key plus an arrow key, while the lower section scrolls it by 10% 
when the Alt or Meta key is used. While the former is quite useful, the 
latter seems rather unimportant. We therefore change the configuration to:

<p>
<pre>
# press arrow + control anywhere, and scroll by 1 page 
Key Left	A	MC	Scroll -100 0 
Key Right	A	MC	Scroll +100 +0 
Key Up		A	MC	Scroll +0   -100 
Key Down	A	MC	Scroll +0   +100 

# press arrow + meta key, and scroll by 1/10 of a page 
#Key Left	A	M	Scroll -10 +0 
#Key Right	A	M	Scroll +10 +0 
#Key Up		A	M	Scroll +0   -10 
#Key Down	A	M	Scroll +0   +10 
</pre>
<p>

This will change it so that the virtual terminal is scrolled a page when 
you type control-meta-arrow (meta in this case is synonymous with alt). If 
this is done, the editor will use control-arrow (left/right) to move the 
cursor by one word, meta-arrow (left/right) to move to the beginning/end of 
a line, and meta-arrow (up/down) to move the cursor to the beginning/end of 
the text.
