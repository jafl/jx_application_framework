<b>Insertion and quoting</b>
<p>

Sending mail falls into two categories, those messages in response to 
received messages, and new messages. When responding to a received message, 
you often need to refer to the text of the message. To insert the quoted 
text of the received message, use <i>Insert quoted</i> from the 
<i>Message</i> menu. At times you may want to refer to several received 
messages. To do this, copy the text from the appriate view window and use 
<i>Paste quoted</i> from the <i>Message</i> menu. An alternative is to drag 
the text from the view window and drop it into the appropriate position in 
the new message. You can then use <i>Quote selected</i> from the 
<i>Message</i> menu to quote the selected text. To insert your signature 
(which is found in ~/.signature), use <i>Insert signature</i> from the 
<i>Message</i> menu.

<p>
<b>Fields</b>
<p>

When you open a new message, only the <i>To:</i> and <i>Subject:</i> fields 
are visible. If you want to add either the <i>Cc:</i>, <i>Reply-To:</i>, or 
<i>Bcc:</i> fields, you can do that via the <i>Message</i> menu.
<p>
The <i>From:</i> pop-up menu lets you select from which 
<a href=jxhelp:GAccountHelp>account</a> to send the message. 

<p>
<a name=Attachments>
<b>Attachments</b>
<p>
E-mail attachments allow you to send files along with your messages. To add 
attachments in arrow, either select <i>Attach files...</i> from the 
<i>Message</i> menu, or drag-and-drop files from an 
<a href=http://www.newplanetsoftware.com/jx/dnd.html>XDND</a> 
compliant file manager (like 
<a href=http://www.newplanetsoftware.com/systemg/>SystemG</a>) 
onto the edit window. Once an attachment has been added, it will 
be displayed in a table to the right of the message text. 
Further attachments can then be dropped either on the message text or 
on the attachment table.
<p>
<a name=Encrypt>
<b>Encryption</b>
<p>

To send a secure message with PGP or GnuPG, edit the message as usual, and then 
select <i>Encrypt</i> from the <i>Message</i> menu. You can specify which 
encryption program you want in the <a href=jxhelp:GPrefsHelp>Preferences</a> 
dialog box.

<p>
<b>Saving and sending</b>
<p>

To send a message, hit the <i>Send</i> button or select <i>Send message</i> 
from the <i>file</i> menu. At times you may want to save a message that you 
are editing. To do this, use <i>Save message</i> from the <i>File</i> menu.

<b>Keyboard shortcuts in the editor</b>
<p>

The arrow keys obviously move the caret around inside the text. Holding 
down the Control key makes the up and down arrows move the caret to the top 
and bottom of the visible text, respectively, while the left and right 
arrows move the caret by one word at a time. Control-up/down is useful for 
scrolling the text by one line without having to use the scrollbar: simply 
press Control-up/down-arrow and then up/down. It is also useful for 
bringing the cursor to the visible text after scrolling. 
 <p>

Holding down the Meta key makes the up and down arrows move the caret to 
the beginning and end of the file, respectively, while the left and right 
arrows move the caret to the beginning and end of the current line, 
respectively. 
<p>

Holding down the Shift key while using the arrow keys selects text. This 
works even in conjunction with the Meta, and Control keys. 
<p>

The backspace key on the main keyboard deletes the character to the left of 
the caret. The delete key on the keypad deletes the character to the right 
of the caret. 

<p>

<a name=CheckSpelling>
<b>Checking your spelling</b>
<p>

If you ever want to check your spelling, use <i>Check spelling</i> from the 
<i>Message</i> menu. This will start the spell checker. If the spell 
checker finds any words that it doesn't understand, it will pop up a dialog 
box with a list of possibilities (if it could find any). You can also edit 
the correction yourself. If the word is correct, hit the <i>Ignore</i> or 
<i>Ignore all</i> buttons. The latter will skip all further occurances of 
the word in question. If the word is incorrect and you edit the spelling or 
choose a spelling from the list, hit the <i>Change</i> or <i>Change all</i> 
buttons. The latter button will change all occurances of the specified word 
to your correction. If a word is correct but is not in the dictionary, you 
can add it to the dictionary by hitting the <i>Learn word</i> or the 
<i>Learn word with caps</i> buttons. Hitting the <i>Close</i> button or 
hitting the escape key will cancel the spell check (when the spell checker 
dialog box is opened).

<p>
<b>Margins</b>
<p>

Some mail programs require that each line be no greater than 80 characters. 
If you wish this to be the case, select the appropriate text, and use 
<i>Clean right margin</i> from the <i>Edit</i> menu, or hit 
<i>Meta-Return</i>.
