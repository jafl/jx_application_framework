<title>Setting up accounts</title>
</head>
If you have multiple accounts, you can set up Arrow to deal with 
each of those accounts separately. Whenever you send mail, you are 
presented with a pop-up menu that lets you specify the account 
from which you want that message to be sent. If you are using POP servers 
to access your mail, Arrow will automatically select the appropriate 
account to use when responding to a message. 
<p>

You create a new account by clicking on the <i>New</i> button on the  
lower left of the account list. You must then specify the <i>Full Name</i>, 
<i>E-mail</i> address, the <i>Default inbox</i>, and the <i>SMTP server</i>, 
which is the outgoing mail server. If you want to, you may also specify a 
<i>Reply to</i> and a <i>Cc</i> for each account.

<b>Getting your mail from a POP server</b>
<p>

When your system is not a mail server, you'll need to have 
some way of downloading mail from one. The most common way of doing 
this is through a POP server. For each account in the Accounts dialog 
you can set up Arrow to access you mail from a POP server. 
<p>
The first step in configuring POP is to select the check box <i>Use POP 
server</i> in the. This will enable all of 
the other POP related settings. 
<p>

If you want Arrow to leave your mail on the server and only download new 
messages, select <i>Leave mail on server</i>. If you want Arrow to save 
your password between sessions, select <i>Save password</i> (though be 
aware that if you do this, your password is saved as plain text in your 
preferences file). If the server is set up to use Authenticated POP (APOP) 
and you have an APOP password, select <i>Use APOP</i>. If you want 
Arrow to automatically check your mail, select <i>Automatically check 
mail</i> along with the time delay between checks. Finally, input your 
POP server into the <i>POP server</i> input field, and your POP account 
or user name into the <i>POP account</i> input field. 

<p>
<b>Receiving mail with POP</b>
<p>

If you have selected <i>Automatically check mail</i>, 
then Arrow will automatically check your mail with the rate that 
you specify. Otherwise, you can check your mail at any time by selecting 
<i>Check mail</i> in the <i>File</i> menu of the message list window. 
You can also check the mail from a specific account by selecting 
that account from the <i>Check account</i> item in the <i>File</i> menu. 
If you have received new 
mail, each message will be delivered 
according to the <a href=jxhelp:GFilterHelp>filters</a> that you've 
specified. If no filters match the messages
they will be delivered to the default inbox specified in 
for that account. 
<p>

<b>Sending mail with POP</b>
<p>

For the most part, sending mail when using POP is the same as if you 
were not using POP at all. The one exception is the <i>SMTP user</i> 
input field. This is the user 
that sendmail will claim sent the message. If this is not set properly 
sendmail may not allow you to send any messages. Typically, this should 
be set to your user name on the POP server.
