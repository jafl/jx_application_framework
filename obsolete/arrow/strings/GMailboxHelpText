<b>Starting Arrow</b>
<p>

When you first run Arrow, you can run it with or without command line 
arguments. Any command line arguments you supply will be presumed to be 
mail files, and Arrow will attempt to open them, each in a separate window. 
If you do not specify any arguments, Arrow will attempt to open your system 
mail file, which is \/var/spool/mail/<i>username</i>\ by default but can be 
specified in the prefences dialog box. You can only have one instance of 
Arrow running at a time, so if you call Arrow again on the command line 
with additional arguments, the currently running Arrow will simply open 
these mail files.

<p>

When you iconize a mail file window, the icon displayed shows an empty 
inbox if you have no mail in the mail file, or an inbox with several 
stacked envelopes if you do have mail in the file. If, while iconized, a 
mail file receives a new message, the icon will change to show an 
un-stacked envelope in the inbox icon. The program will also beep to alert 
you.

<p>

To view a message, select it and press the Return key, or double-click on 
it with the mouse.

<b>Rearranging and deleting</b>
<p>

The main mail file windows contain a list of message headers, showing who 
the message is from, what the subject is, and so on. These messages can be 
rearranged by click-dragging them to the desired position with the mouse 
and then releasing the mouse button. If you wish to delete a message or 
messages, select those you wish to delete and hit Meta-D or the Backspace 
key. You can also select <i>Delete</i> from the <i>Message</i> menu. The 
messages you choose to delete will be marked by an <i>X</i> and will not be 
actually deleted until you select <i>Flush</i> or <i>Save</i> from the 
<i>File</i> menu, or close the window. If you decide you don't want to 
delete a message after marking it delete, select it and select 
<i>Undelete</i> from the <i>Message</i> menu.

<b>Saving mail</b>
<p>

To move messages to another mail file, first open the destination mail file 
by using the <i>Open mailbox...</i> or <i>New mailbox</i> menu items in the 
<i>File</i> menu, then select the messages you want to move, finally drag 
the selected messages to the desination mail file. 

<p>
<a name=Inboxes>
<b>Inboxes</b>
<p>

There are two types of mail files, those that receive new messages 
directly, and those that do not. The former are called inboxes. To 
designate a mail file as an inbox, select <i>Add inbox</i> from the 
<i>Inbox</i> menu, or hit meta (or alt) and the plus key. To remove a mail 
file from the inbox list, select <i>Remove inbox</i> or hit meta and the 
minus key. You can open a specific inbox at any time by selecting it from 
the list in the <i>Inbox</i> menu.

<p>

Once a mail file is designated as an inbox, Arrow will continually monitor 
the file. If an inbox is not currently open, and it receives new mail, 
Arrow will open it iconized. You can then view the messages by 
double-clicking on the icon.
