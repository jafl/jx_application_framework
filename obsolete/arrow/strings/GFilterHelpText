<title>Setting up filters</title>
</head>
<a name=Purpose>
<b>What is the point of filters?</b>
<p>

Mail filters are an important way to maintain order in your mailboxes. 
As the volume of incoming mail goes up, the ability to sift through it and to 
distinguish the junk mail from the important mail becomes harder and 
harder. Filters sift the mail for you, before you read it, separating 
out messages that are important to you. 
<p>

Filters separate out messages that match various conditions that you 
specify, and perform an action upon those messages, typically either 
saving them in a specified mailbox, or forwarded them to another e-mail 
address. Filters always have to have an action associated with them, 
but it is possible to have no conditions. If there are no conditions, 
then any mail not filtered to that point will be acted upon by the actions 
you specify.
<p>

<b>Filter dialog</b>
<p>

The filter dialog contains three tables. The top table is a list of 
filters, the middle table is a list of the current filter's 
<a href=jxhelp:GFilterHelp#Conditions>conditions</a>, 
and the bottom table is a list of the current filter's 
<a href=jxhelp:GFilterHelp#Actions>actions</a>. 
<p>

<b>Conditions</b>
<p>

Conditions tell the filter what to look for in a message. For example, 
you might want all mail from bob@hostname.com to be saved in its own 
mailbox. When you create a new condition (by clicking on the <i>New</i> 
button to the right of the condition list), a new line is added to the 
condition list. Each 
condition has three columns. The first column specifies where to look. 
The choices include, the <i>From</i>, <i>To</i>, <i>Cc</i>, <i>Subject</i>, 
<i>ReplyTo</i>, and <i>AnyTo</i> headers, in addition to <i>Any header</i>, 
where, <i>AnyTo</i> refers to any header specifying the sender, like 
<i>To</i>, <i>Cc</i>, <i>Bcc</i>, etc. Finally, the first column can 
specify to look in the body. 

The second column specifies how the first column relates to the condition. 
The available relationships specify that the appropriate section of the 
message <i>Contains</i>, 
<i>Is</i>, <i>Begins with</i>, or <i>Ends with</i> the pattern in the 
third column. The pattern in the third column is compared to the section of 
the message that is refered to in the first column. 
Patterns can be a single word, or a complex regular expression. 
 If all conditions 
are met, the actions in the action list for that filter are performed. 
<p>

<a name=Actions>
<b>Actions</b>
<p>

The actions in a filter's action list are performed whenever all of the 
filter's conditions are met. There are two possible actions. Either the 
message that meets the conditions can be saved to a specified mailbox, 
or the message can be forwarded to another e-mail address. Whenver you 
specify an action, you must also specify whether the action should be performed 
on the message itself, or on a copy of the message. If the action is 
performed on the message itself, all filtering stops. If, on the other 
hand, the action is performed on a copy of the message, then 
the filtering process continues on the original message, with the filters 
listed after the initial matching filter. If you specify multiple actions 
for one filter, all but the last action <i>must</i> act upon a copy of 
the message, otherwise there wouldn't be a message left to act upon for the 
subsequent actions. For this reason, you are only able to set the last 
action to use the original and not a copy.
