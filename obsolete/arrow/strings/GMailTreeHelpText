<b>Mailbox list overview</b>

<p>

The mailbox window gives you access to any number of mailboxes located 
in any readable directory that you specify. The directories are viewed 
as an openable list. You can open mailboxes in the list and drop messages 
on to mailboxes in the list.

<p>

<b>Adding mailboxes</b> 

<p>

To add a single mailbox, select the <i>Add mailbox</i> menu item from the 
<i>Mailboxes</i> menu. You can create a new mailbox by selecting the 
<i>New mailbox</i> menu item from the <i>Mailboxes</i> menu. 
You can also create a new mailbox by dropping 
a message on a directory. The new mailbox will be created in that 
directory, and you will be asked to provide a name for this new mailbox. 

<p>

<b>Adding mailbox directories</b>

<p>

A directory of mailboxes can be added by selecting <i>Add directory</i> 
from the <i>Mailboxes</i> menu. You can also create a new directory 
by selecting <i>New directory</i> from the <i>Mailboxes</i> menu. 

<p>

<b>Deleting mailboxes</b> 

<p>

If you wish to delete a mailbox, click on it with the mouse and 
select <i>Delete from file system</i> from the <i>Mailboxes</i> menu. 

<p>

<b>Removing and deleting mailbox directories</b>

<p>

If you wish to remove a directory, click on it with the mouse and 
select <i>Remove from list</i> from the <i>Mailboxes</i> menu. 
If you wish to delete a directory, click on it with the mouse and 
select <i>Delete from file system</i> from the <i>Mailboxes</i> menu. 

<p>

<b>Unlocking mailboxes</b> 

<p>

Whenever a mailbox is being accessed, it is locked to prevent other 
programs from changing it while it is being accessed. The mailbox window 
indicates that a mailbox is locked by drawing a locked strap around the 
mailbox icon. Sometimes, one of the many programs that access a mailbox 
crashes, leaving a mailbox locked. This will prevent this mailbox from 
being accessed by any other program. If this happens, you can unlock the 
mailbox by clicking on it with the mouse and 
selecting <i>Unlock</i> from the <i>Mailboxes</i> menu.
