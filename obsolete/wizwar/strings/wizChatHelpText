<h3> The Chat Window </h3>

The Chat window displays messages from the WizWar server about the game's progress and
messages from the other players.  The latter are preceded by the player's color for easy
identification.  You cannot type in the display area of the window.
<p>
The message input at the bottom of the window lets you enter messages to be sent to the
other players.  The upper menu at the left (which displays your name) provides access to
the messages specified in <tt>~/.jx_wizwar/chat_messages</tt>.  The format of this file
is described below.  The lower menu at the left (\"Send to\") lets you choose which player(s)
should receive the message.
<p>
When a message is sent, it is interpreted as a statement if it starts with a double quote
mark (\") and preceded by \"<i>player</i> says, \".  Otherwise, it is assumed to begin with
a verb conjugated in the third person, so it is only preceded by your name.
<p>
Each message that you send is echoed in your Chat window and enclosed in parentheses.
This way, you have a record of the complete conversation, and you can easily tell which
messages where yours without even having to check the color.

<h3> Specifying commonly used messages </h3>

You can specify commonly used messages in the file <tt>~/.jx_wizwar/chat_messages</tt>.
The format includes the option of a shortcut which can be typed in the message input so
that you do not have to use the mouse to select from the menu.  After typing the shortcut,
you can either send the message, at which point it will be automatically replaced by the full
text of the message from the menu, or you can press Tab to expand the shortcut and then keep
typing.  Because of the former behavior, the shortcut will only work if there is no other text
in the message input.
<p>
The file format is line based.  A blank line is converted to a separator between menu items.
Non-empty lines have the format:  \"<i>shortcut</i> whitespace <i>text</i>\".  <i>shortcut</i> is
optional, but the whitespace (at least one space or tab) is required.
