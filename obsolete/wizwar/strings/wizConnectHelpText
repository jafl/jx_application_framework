<h3> Connecting to the WizWar server </h3>

In order to play WizWar, you must first connect to a running WizWar server.
This requires that you know the Internet address of the server.  The format of
the address is <u>hostname</u>:<u>port</u>.  The default port is 2000.
<p>
In addition, you must also specify a nickname.  This nickname is especially
important if the game is anonymous.
