It is a huge amount of work to write a program from scratch.  All forms of 
encouragement (including suggestions, encouragement, and donations) are 
therefore gratefully accepted.
<p>
My thanks to everyone who has submitted bug reports, suggestions, and/or code. 
If you find a bug or have a suggestion for improving this program, please 
let me know.
