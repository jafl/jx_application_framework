Styles To do:

GNBNoteDir:

In Save, after WriteGeometry, write some marker, then call: 		
	WritePrivateFormat(ostream& output).
	
In constructor, after ReadGeometry, do a JTellg and look at that point in the
JStaticBuffer to see if the marker matches if it does, JSeekg past the marker
and call:

	ReadPrivateFormat(istream& input);

otherwise, do what is currently being done.


Perhaps:

 char marker[5];
 marker[0]	= (char)1;
 marker[1]	= (char)2;
 marker[2]	= (char)3;
 marker[4]	= (char)4;

then:

 for (JIndex i = 0; i < 4; i++)
 	{
 	cout << marker[i];
 	}
