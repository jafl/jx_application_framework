The names of node voltages are \"NV&lt;node number&gt;\".  The names of branch currents
are \"B&lt;component name&gt;\".
<p>
When using the NDI window, you may get back exactly what you asked it to evaluate.
When this happens, reverse the order of the two sources and try again.  (This
often happens if one source is forced to be zero and the other isn't.)
<p>
Occaisionally, Mathematica will wander off into the blue and forget to reply
to your request.  If this happens, simply click on the Cancel button and try again.
(Since Mathematica can be quite slow on large problems, you must be the judge of
how long is too long.)
<p>
If a result is indeterminate (e.g. 0/0), then it will be left empty so that it
displays a question mark.
