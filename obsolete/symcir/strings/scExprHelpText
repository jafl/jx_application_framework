<title> Entering Expressions </title>
</head>

The simplest way to explain the interface is that you just type as if you
were entering a text expression.  The expression will be built graphically as
you type.  The details are explained below.
<p>
Variable names can contain Greek characters and subscripts.  To type a Greek
character, either use the Font menu or type a back quote ( ` ).  The back quote
toggles between Normal and Greek fonts.
<p>
New expressions are initally empty.  This is drawn as a single question mark (?),
which represents an empty input field.  When you click on the input field, it becomes
active, and you are ready to start typing.
<p>
Input fields accept numbers and variable names.  When you enter an operator, the
input field is parsed and becomes part of the expression, and a new input field is
created based on which operator you typed.  The operators are as follows:
<pre>
   +  addition
   -  subtraction
   *  multiplication
   /  division
   ^  exponentiation
   |  parallel combination:  x||y = x*y/(x+y)
</pre>
You actually only need to type a unique prefix of the variable name that you want to
enter because the editor will complete it for you automatically when parsing it.
<p>
While entering a number, typing \"e\" lets you enter the exponent.
<p>
Input fields also accept certain pre-defined constants:
<pre>
   pi = 3.141592654...
   e  = 2.718281828...
   i  = sqrt(-1)
   j  = sqrt(-1) (for Electrical Engineers)
</pre>
You can also enter the names of pre-defined functions.  The function name is parsed
when you type a left parenthesis \"(\".
<pre>
   sqrt       square root
   abs        absolute value
   sign       algebraic sign (+1, -1)
   round      nearest integer
   truncate   toss fractional part

   log        logarithm to an arbitrary base
   log10      logarithm base 10
   ln         natural logarithm
   log2       logarithm base 2

   sin        sine
   cos        cosine
   tan        tangent
   arcsin     inverse sine (in degrees)
   arccos     inverse cosine (in degrees)
   arctan     inverse tangent(x) (in degrees, -90 to +90)
   arctan2    inverse tangent(x,y) (in degrees, -180 to +180)

   sinh       hyperbolic sine
   cosh       hyperbolic cosine
   tanh       hyperbolic tangent

   re         real part
   im         imaginary part
   arg        phase angle (in degrees)
   conjugate  complex conjugate
   rotate     rotate(complex number, angle to rotate in degrees)

   max        maximum of its arguments
   min        minimum of its arguments
   parallel   parallel combination: x||y = x*y/(x+y)
</pre>
The last three functions can take an arbitrary number of arguments.
Typing a comma ( , ) adds another argument.
<p>
While entering an expression, the return key, the space bar, and the right
parenthesis \")\" all parse the current input field and then select it.
The spacebar and the right parenthesis will extend the
selection \"upwards\" when pressed again.  This allows you to enter an
expression like <tt>x^2+1</tt> without using the mouse by typing <tt>x ^ 2 space
space + 1</tt>
<p>
Selecting a piece of the expression lets you manipulate it using the Math menu.
The Function submenu transfers the selection to the first argument of the function
that you select from the menu.  Typing an operator works just like when entering
the expression.  The Delete key replaces the selection with an input field.  Typing
Delete again deletes the input field.  Typing other text replaces the selection with
an input field.
<p>
Double clicking on a number or a variable name lets you edit it.
<p>
There can be more than one empty input field in an expression.  A question mark
is used to represent each one.  The Tab key moves you from one input field to another.
