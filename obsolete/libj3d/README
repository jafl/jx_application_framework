Changes from previous versions are described in J3DLibVersion.h

J3D uses Mesa, which implements the OpenGL 1.1 API and is released under
the GNU Library General Public Licence (LGPL).  You can get more
information from the Web page:

    http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~brianp/Mesa.html

Mesa can be downloaded from:

    http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~brianp/Mesa.html
    ftp://ftp.newplanetsoftware.com/pub/jx/

If you already have it installed, you don't need to do anything extra.  If
it is not installed, download it, build it, and create a link called "Mesa"
in the main JX directory that points to the main Mesa directory.

J3D is still embryonic.  The design is described at:
