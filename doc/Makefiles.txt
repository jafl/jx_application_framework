    The top level Makefile will automatically build all libraries placed in
directories of the form lib.+ and then all programs in subdirectories of the
tools directory.  In order for this to work correctly, certain files and make
targets are required.

    Each library must provide Make.header and Make.files in its top level
directory.  Refer to libjfs/Make.header and libjfs/Make.header for examples.

    Make.header must also provide the target "Makefiles" to build the Makefiles
in any subdirectories.  (e.g. the Makefile for the test suite)  Make.header
should also define "tidy" and "clean" as double colon targets to clean up any
subdirectories.  (e.g. the test suite)  The source distribution should also
include a symbolic link placed in the include directory that points to the
library's header files and a symbolic link placed in the lib directory that
points to the static version of the library in the library's top level
directory.  The jfs library provides an example of how to do all this.

    Each library must also provide a *_constants file in include/make/.  This
defines version numbers, shortcuts, and augments J_STRING_FILES to include all
string database files that are required by the library.  All program Make.header
files include these *_constants files.  jfs_constants provides an example of
how to do this.
