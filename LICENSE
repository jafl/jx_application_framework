---------------

Please note that libraries and programs built on top of the JX Application
Framework may unpack inside the JX source directory, but they may still be
subject to a different license.

If you need to modify the JX Application Framework source, either to get it
to compile on your system or to enhance it, you will save yourself a lot of
trouble by first discussing it with us because (1) it might already have
been done in preparation for the next release, (2) we can check that it
won't disrupt any of the myriad subtle interactions between library
components, and (3) we might think of an easier way to do it.

The LGPL requires that you release all successful changes to the JX
Application Framework under the same license.  Custom widgets built on top
of JX are your own and are not subject to the LGPL, so you can do as you
wish with them, but we encourage you to make them available so others can
use them.

Both JCore and JX use the The ADAPTIVE Communication Environment (ACE)
library for all their networking needs.  According to the author of ACE,
Doug Schmidt, you are only required to mention ACE in your documentation if
you use it directly.  Indirect use via JCore or JX functionality does not
require you to mention it.  (But it wouldn't hurt if you mentioned it
anyway :)  The minimal text is:

    ACE is copyrighted by Douglas C. Schmidt and his research group at
    Washington University, Copyright (c) 1993-1997, all rights reserved.
