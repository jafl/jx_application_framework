This source code demonstrates how to implement version 1 of the XSearch
protocol.

It is not stand-alone code since it depends heavily on services provided by
the JX Application Framework.  These services are encapsulated in clearly
named functions, however, so it should be clear what most of them do.

This implementation uses C++.  If you use a different language (especially
C), please consider donating your code for others to look at.

If you have any questions about the code, please feel free to ask me.
