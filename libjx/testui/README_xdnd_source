This source code demonstrates how to implement version 4 of the XDND
protocol for both inter- and intra-application transfers.

It is not stand-alone code since it depends heavily on services provided by
the JX Application Framework.  These services are encapsulated in clearly
named functions, however, so it should be clear what most of them do.

Also, please note that this code may be slightly more complex than what you
need to implement.  JX creates a single X window to contain an arbitrary
number of widgets, while most libraries create a separate X window for each
widget.

JXSelectionManager is included because it contains as an example of how to
implement the INCR selection transfer protocol.

jXUtil is included to show how to convert file names to and from text/uri-list.

This implementation uses C++.  If you use a different language (especially
C), please consider donating your code for others to look at.

If you have any questions about the code, please feel free to ask me.
