This binary implements Version 4 of the XDND protocol.  You can drop
anything on the main window that appears when the application starts up,
and you can drag text from and drop text into the text editor windows that
you get by selecting "Text editor" from the Test menu.

The main window will only accept drops with action copy.  This demonstrates
that the user can safely change action while dragging.

When dragging from a text editor, Meta toggles between move and copy, while
holding down the Control key sets the action to ask.

The Xpm and ACE libraries have been statically linked.
