<h3> Special key sequences </h3>

You can choose which keys on your keyboard should map to the Multi_key and
the character modifier keys by using <tt>xmodmap</tt> in your <tt>~/.xinitrc</tt>
file.  As an example, if you have a PC keyboard with the new Windows Menu key
near the lower right corner, you can make it the Multi_key:

<blockquote><tt>
xmodmap -e \"keycode 117 = Multi_key\" <br>
</tt></blockquote>

To check what each key does, use \"<tt>xmodmap -pke</tt>\".
<p>
You can use <tt>xev</tt> to get the keycode for a particular key on your
keyboard.  Run it from an <tt>xterm</tt>, move the cursor into the resulting
window, press the key, and check the keycode value that is printed.
<p>
The following characters can be entered by typing the corresponding
sequence of keys on the keyboard.  These sequences are defined in a
Compose file in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/.
