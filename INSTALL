*** Step 1:  Preparation

You need gcc 2.96 (or later) and GNU's version of make.

You should find a computer where you can compile to the local disk.
Compiling to a remote disk over NFS is usually very slow.

Decide where you want the JX-2.5.0 directory to reside.  Absolute paths are
compiled into some of the utility programs, so you will have to rebuild
everything if you move JX-2.5.0 to a different location after building it.


*** Step 2:  Compiling

If you want the binaries installed somewhere other than ~/bin (or
JX-2.5.0/bin, if ~/bin doesn't exist), set the environment variable
JX_INSTALL_ROOT to the desired directory.

  Use "setenv JX_INSTALL_ROOT value" at the top of ~/.cshrc if you use csh
  or "export JX_INSTALL_ROOT=value" at the top of ~/.bashrc if you use
  bash.

This directory (JX-2.5.0/bin, ~/bin, or $JX_INSTALL_ROOT), must be on your
execution path.

  Use "set path = ( new_path $path )" at the top of ~/.cshrc if you use csh
  or "export PATH=new_path:$PATH" at the top of ~/.bashrc if you use bash.

Do not add JX-2.5.0/lib to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  This will cause conflicts
with the shared libraries used by Code Crusader, Code Medic, etc.

Run "make" and following the instructions for setting ACE_ROOT and
compiling the libraries and utility programs.  This will compile everything
and install the programs.  You can ignore any errors that make ignores.

  You can avoid installing the binaries by setting the environment variable
  J_WANT_INSTALL equal to 0.

  Everything in JX-2.5.0 will be built, including any 3rd party libraries
  and programs that you unpack after the main distribution.

If you cannot use the version of libXpm already installed on your system
(e.g. because it is too old) or if you do not have libXpm at all, then
uncomment the definition of JX_INCLUDE_LIBXPM near the top of the
appropriate file in include/make/sys/

Since ACE is huge, only one version of the library is built.  If you want
the other version as well, go to the ACE directory and type "make shared"
or "make static" after you have built everything else.

If your system is not already supported, create another entry in the
Makefile by copying one of the existing ones and modifying it as follows:

  Start by assuming that jMissingProto_empty.h is appropriate. If you get
  compile errors, create a new one and fill it with whatever is necessary.

  Create a new file in include/make/sys/ by copying template_g++ and
  editing the "Adjustable Parameters" section.

  If you cannot find a suitable pair of ACE configuration files, contact
  the developers.  (http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html)

  Once you get the entire distribution to compile, contact me so I can add
  your patches to the distribution so you won't have to do it again.


*** Step 3:  Additional configuration

Get the xforms distribution from

	http://world.std.com/~xforms/

and extract the fdesign binary.  This should be placed in ~/bin. (or
$JX_INSTALL_ROOT, if you set it)  fdesign is the graphical layout tool.

It is also a good idea to set the following environment variables:

    setenv JMM_INITIALIZE   "default"
    setenv JMM_SHRED        "default"

Check libjcore/code/JMemoryManager.cc for more information.


*** Step 4:  Compiling the other sample programs

To compile the tutorials or test suites, go to the directory and run first
makemake and then make.


*** Step 5:  Creating your own programs

If you are using Code Crusader, create a new project using the
JX_application project template.  Otherwise run jx_project_wizard directly.
This will give you a skeleton program to get you started.
