menu editor
	build visually - copy from jcc
	remove bin/extract_menu_strings

generates id for every item
	fixed prefix, so these are excluded from toolbar config
	override to provide useful value and include in toolbar config

menu itself has id
	generates string with list of item id's + separator locations
		item-id::text
		item-idid::macshortcut - if set
		item-idid::winshortcut - if set
	construct JXTextMenu directly from this
	JXMenu broadcasts item id, not index
		all menus constructed in BuildWindow and passed to widgets
		(widgets do not need to own menu data + enum)
