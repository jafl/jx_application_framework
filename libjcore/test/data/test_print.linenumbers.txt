 1       "I HAVE A DREAM ..." (Copyright 1963, MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.)
 2  
 3  I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the gre
 4  atest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.
 5  
 6  Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand to
 7  day, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a g
 8  reat beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in
 9   the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the 
10  long night of their captivity.
11  
12  But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years 
13  later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segr
14  egation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro
15   lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of materia
16  l prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the 
17  corners of American society and finds himself in exile in his own land. And 
18  so we’ve come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.
19  
20  In a sense we’ve come to our nation’s capital to cash a check. When the arch
21  itects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and t
22  he Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which
23   every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes,
24   black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights 
25  of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It is obvious today that Ame
26  rica has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color 
27  are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given
28   the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked insufficie
29  nt funds.
30  
31  But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to 
32  believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity
33   of this nation. And so we’ve come to cash this check, a check that will giv
34  e us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.
35  
36  We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urge
37  ncy of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to tak
38  e the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the pro
39  mises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valle
40  y of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to li
41  ft our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of b
42  rotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God’s child
43  ren.
44  
45  It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This
46   sweltering summer of the Negro’s legitimate discontent will not pass until 
47  there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. 1963 is not an end,
48   but a beginning. And those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam
49   and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to
50   business as usual. There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America un
51  til the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt wi
52  ll continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of j
53  ustice emerges.
54  
55  But there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on the warm t
56  hreshold which leads into the palace of justice: in the process of gaining o
57  ur rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek 
58  to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and
59   hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity a
60  nd discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into phy
 61  sical violence. Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of me
 62  eting physical force with soul force. The marvelous new militancy which has
 63   engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white p
 64  eople, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here 
 65  today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny,
 66   and they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to 
 67  our freedom. We cannot walk alone.
 68  
 69  And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. W
 70  e cannot turn back. There are those who are asking the devotees of civil ri
 71  ghts, “When will you be satisfied?” We can never be satisfied as long as th
 72  e Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We ca
 73  n never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of trave
 74  l, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the 
 75  cities. We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro’s basic mobility is fro
 76  m a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as ou
 77  r children are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by si
 78  gns stating for whites only. We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in M
 79  ississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for 
 80  which to vote. No, no, we are not satisfied and we will not be satisfied un
 81  til justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.
 82  
 83  I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and 
 84  tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. Some of y
 85  ou have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by t
 86  he storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. Yo
 87  u have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the f
 88  aith that unearned suffering is redemptive. Go back to Mississippi, go back
 89   to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Loui
 90  siana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing tha
 91  t somehow this situation can and will be changed. Let us not wallow in the 
 92  valley of despair.
 93  
 94  I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of 
 95  today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in th
 96  e American dream.
 97  
 98  I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true 
 99  meaning of its creed: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all me
100  n are created equal.”
101  
102  I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former
103   slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down togeth
104  er at the table of brotherhood.
105  
106  I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state swelteri
107  ng with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will
108   be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.
109  
110  I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation w
111  here they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content 
112  of their character. I have a dream today.
113  
114  I have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with
115   its governor having his lips dripping with the words of “interposition” an
116  d “nullification”, one day right there in Alabama little black boys and bla
117  ck girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls 
118  as sisters and brothers. I have a dream today.
119  
120  I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and m
121  ountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the cro
122  oked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revea
123  led, and all flesh shall see it together.
124  
125  This is our hope. This is the faith that I go back to the South with. With 
126  this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of
127   hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords o
128  f our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith we w
129  ill be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go
130   to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will b
131  e free one day.
132  
133  This will be the day, this will be the day when all of God’s children will 
134  be able to sing with new meaning: “My country, ‘tis of thee, sweet land of 
135  liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrim’s 
136  pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring!”
137  
138  And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true. So let freed
139  om ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire. Let freedom ring fro
140  m the mighty mountains of New York. Let freedom ring from the heightening A
141  lleghenies of Pennsylvania. Let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies o
142  f Colorado. Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California. But 
143  not only that: Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia. Let freedom
144   ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee. Let freedom ring from every hill 
145  and molehill of Mississippi. From every mountainside, let freedom ring.
146  
147  And when this happens, and when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring 
148  from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we wi
149  ll be able to speed up that day when all of God’s children, black men and w
150  hite men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to joi
151  n hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual: “Free at last! Fr
152  ee at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!”
