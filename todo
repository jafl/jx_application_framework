Docking
	OSX: window placement inside dock sometimes wrong (iconfied windows)
	undock: window placement not restored
	raise window via menu shortcut:  dock moves on Ubuntu, and focus not set to the window

	When compartment minimized and move tab position, should readjust pane sizes
	When min page size increases in dock, adjust panes so divider visible
		(test:  move tab group tabs from side to top)

arrow
	when show full headers in HTML mode, doesn't update link ranges
	fix SaveState() so it doesn't need JFileArray
	specify timeout for lockfile and handle it as lock failure
*	doesn't save drafts if no inbox open
*	doesn't recv mail if flush inbox during download (locking problem?)

svn_client:
	svn update doesn't always restore to correct scroll location (if lots of files)
	incremental search in SVNListBase:  only search file name
	show multiple files in same folder in systemg:  only selects last one

	Repo tab for "svn list"
		refresh selected nodes
			find closest directory parent for each selected item
			add open subitems to tree's open list and then call Update on each one

	svn log:
		kJForceNonblockingPipe doesn't fully solve the problem

	Input field on every action tab

	allow range to be away from origin
	edit axis scale:  min, max, delta

multi-pane editing:
	split off itsBuffer,itsStyles,itsUndo/RedoList into JTextBuffer
	leave recalc engine, cursor location, and other display stuff in JTextEditor
	JTextEditor can be constructed from string or JTextBuffer
	CBTextEditor has handle to {JTextBuffer, refCount}
	Edit menu has "New view..." which opens another CBTextEditor and incr refCount
	When close, only require save if refCount == 1
	Active undo needs to know which view it is for
		since event from another view needs to deactivate it and create new one

JKeyHandler:
	if we build key handlers for different file types:
		specify key handler in CharAction config
		JKeyHandlerStack extends JKeyHandler
			to combine different key handlers, can construct a stack
			if one returns kJFalse, the next one gets it

Mondrian:
	build
		string list

		JXLayoutCanvas contains tree of JXLayoutObject
		JXLayoutObject has option to accept drop to create child node
	layout window options
		show rulers/grid
		snap to grid (5,10,other)
		align selected: top,bottom,center; right,left,center
		outline bounding rects
	need option to control tab order
		show index in each item
		cmd-click to select item without re-ordering
		click to make object the next in list
	resize object:  only show corner handles if object very small
	special object for JXTabGroup, to allow direct editing of all cards
	sizing references

	Tooltip-like window when open function arg list
		bold current argument, based on number of commas after opening paren
	Tooltip for scrolltabs: which function it is in
	Tooltip while scrolling: which function it is in
	PHP styler:
		falls out of PHP mode when it sees ?>
		while editing string, it may find ?> that should be inside string
	PHP class tree
	tabs/spaces:
		search up in directory tree until find .project_modeline
		parse some standard format to get tabs/spaces settings
		publish as open protocol on newplanetsoftware.com

	perl:  = 2 ?
		Delete 2, type 2 => styles are wrong to next ?
		Same with /, because both are regex constructs
		Need to restyle further?

	When search for something in CVS output window, doesn't hilight selection
	until wheel-mouse scroll.

	When cvs diff is run in directory with .jcc file, loses data from middle of
	.jcc contents to some later point -- only seen on work machine, and only
	with old single, line format

	CBTreeDirector:
		ReceiveWithFeedback:  include src file for C++
	Editor for regex's so compiler support is not hard-coded
	Cascade option for undocked windows
	Option to search all files in current project
	Symbol list: print unique prefix for file names (like in Files window)
	PHP: balance <? ?>
	JXChooseMonoFont: allow "Other..."

	Class trees need to search symbol database for function location.

	takes a long time to figure out that a 251MB file is large enough to
	warn about -- is the underlying code somehow reading the file to figure out
	how big it is?

drakon:
	FreeBSD missing
		size, resident, share
		utime, stime always zero

	filter input, like jcc file list

	re-nice dialog: slider
		if 0, default 19
		else, default 0

	SendSignal dialog

Clean up prefs
	JXPrefsDialog has tree list and card file
		tree list pane adjusts width to bounds of tree list
		card file pane sets min size to union of card sizes
	Split CBTextEditorPrefs into multiple panes
	factor out JXEditStylesWidget from JXEditStylesDialog so it can be a card

Dock
	Key shortcuts to move between dock compartments
		What key?  Tab is fully loaded in jcc
		cycle through leaf nodes of tree from left to right
		(first, build array of leaf nodes, then find current pane and switch to next)

JXHelpDirector:
	Add forward and backward buttons/menus
	Middle-click on link => new window
	Right-click on link => menu
		"Open %k Left-click | Open in new window %k Middle-click"

JPrefsManager:
	Atomic lock around SaveToDisk(), etc. in case multiple instances try writing

JTextEditor::DrawInMargin
	line #'s

		start with JXButton
	jXGlobals loads all ddls in theme directory that start with theme ID
	http://www.newplanetsoftware/jx/theme.php

widget factory:
	JX defines function pointer and sets it to JX widget factory
	other library installs its function pointer and saves original => linked list
object model:
	query available values on any object
	query value by name on any object
	object constructor initializes hash table of get/set function pointers
		in base class JXWidget
	need generalized object to contain values for get/set
