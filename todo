Linux Window Manager
	activate shifts window up & left
	contents of medic Files window not adjusted to window size

JTextEditor:
	need smarter update during indent/outdent, to maintain caret location
		when caret in another view is inside the affected range

	don't change insertion font while typing when glyphs are rendered with fallback font

-----

switch to cairo for rendering
	anti-aliased lines
	postscript printing

Fedora 27 window manager
	JXWindow does not analyze correctly

JPrefsManager
	Atomic lock around SaveToDisk(), etc. in case multiple instances try writing

When g++/clang++ both support stringstream::view
	fix JString::Encode/DecodeBase64

-----

memory analyzer
	jcc -- crash with deleted JMessageProtocol -- only when open project
	print table:  partial column on page 1

	option to print MDStatsDirector
	records window:
		show info about query in window title

Clean up prefs
	JXPrefsDialog has tree list and card file
		tree list pane adjusts width to bounds of tree list
		card file pane sets min size to union of card sizes
	Split CBTextEditorPrefs into multiple panes
	factor out JXEditStylesWidget from JXEditStylesDialog so it can be a card

Docking
	MacOS: window placement inside dock sometimes wrong (iconfied windows)
	undock: window placement not restored
	raise window via menu shortcut:
		dock moves on Ubuntu, and focus not set to the window

	When compartment minimized and move tab position, should readjust pane sizes
	When min page size increases in dock, adjust panes so divider visible
		(test:  move tab group tabs from side to top)

	Key shortcuts to move between dock compartments
		What key?  Tab is fully loaded in jcc
		cycle through leaf nodes of tree from left to right
		(first, build array of leaf nodes, then find current pane and switch to next)

JKeyHandler
	if we build key handlers for different file types:
		specify key handler in CharAction config
		JKeyHandlerStack extends JKeyHandler
			to combine different key handlers, can construct a stack
			if one returns kJFalse, the next one gets it

JXFontManager
	some characters extend above line height

JTextEditor::DrawInMargin
	line #'s
	bookmarks -- easier to see which line was marked

cygwin
	systemg:  dragging files doesn't work
	jcc:  dragging files from systemg to diff dialog doesn't work

ASIO
	http://think-async.com/Asio
	source is half the size of ACE, but it's all header files - everything is inline
	JXApplication should call io_service::poll_one()

switch to xcb
	awful API
		uses 16bit characters for text extents
	does not support XIM

exceptions suck
	invisible; not self-documenting
	infects the entire call tree
	unwinds the stack, so core dump is useless
	tricky for partially constructed objects
