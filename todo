OSX window placement
	modal windows, e.g., File Chooser, still migrate upward
	System G windows in dirs with no prefs open downward
	jcc man page window and "find file" result window appear under active window

Docking
	OSX: window placement inside dock sometimes wrong (iconfied windows)
	undock: window placement not restored
	raise window via menu shortcut:  dock moves on Ubuntu, and focus not set to the window

	When compartment minimized and move tab position, should readjust pane sizes
	When min page size increases in dock, adjust panes so divider visible
		(test:  move tab group tabs from side to top)

		Same with /, because both are regex constructs
		Need to restyle further?

	When search for something in CVS output window, doesn't hilight selection
	until wheel-mouse scroll.

	When cvs diff is run in directory with .jcc file, loses data from middle of
	.jcc contents to some later point -- only seen on work machine, and only

UTF-8
	convert one file at a time
		intermediate should be safe, except maybe confusion in JTextEditor/rendering
	JString
		if input not valid UTF-8, convert from ISO8859-1 (configurable?)
		store character count separate from byte count
		static functions: utf8_strlen, utf8_prev(&i), utf8_next(&i)
	for loops must use utf8_next/prev instead of i++/--

	JRegex::defaultCFlags: add PCRE_UTF8

	UTF8_STRING for X selection
	use real X compose mechanism
