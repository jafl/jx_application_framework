Fedora 27 window manager
	JXWindow does not analyze correctly

multi-pane editing
	CBTextDocument owns JXStyledText
	use partitions to show multiple views
		double appropriate window dimension, if screen has space
	each partition needs small [x] to close
	small [+] buttons to split either horiz or vert

JPrefsManager
	Atomic lock around SaveToDisk(), etc. in case multiple instances try writing

When g++/clang++ both support stringstream::view
	fix JString::Encode/DecodeBase64

medic - java
	selected stack frame
		select source line
			get code offset <-> line number for method
			search for frame's code offset
		show local variables
			get list of method's variables (slot #'s)
			get frame's value for each slot #'s
	start JVM
		JVMDisplaySourceForMain
			get Methods for main-class, find "main", get LineTable, get first line number, scroll to that
	set breakpoint
		search code index <-> line index for location

xdebug
	click stack trace: selection jumps back to last frame
	temp breakpoint doesn't disappear

	Enable XDSocket::StartTimer() when not debugging
	Always update stack, even if Stack Trace window is hidden
	Eliminate double call to get local vars
		Preserve existing items; don't just delete all before update
	request source from debugger instead of assuming that file:// exists
	*set* values
	support conditional breakpoints, etc.

jcc
	D tree
		must remember all imported packages, to resolve parents after full parse
		imports are scoped to block

	execute selected text by passing to interpreter running in command window
		perl/php -- executes only after closing pipe, wrap php in <? ... ?> if not already there
		python/ruby -- write to pipe after invoking, to allow inspecting result

	Pick a default size and location for text windows when first run
		based on desktop size (if not auto-dock all)

	search results:  option to show n lines above and below matching line

	Tooltip-like window when open function arg list
		bold current argument, based on number of commas after opening paren
	Tooltip for scrolltabs: which function it is in
	Tooltip while scrolling: which function it is in

	Editor for regex's so compiler support is not hard-coded
	Cascade option for undocked windows
	Option to search all files in current project
	Symbol list: print unique prefix for file names (like in Files window)
	PHP: balance <? ?>
	JXChooseMonoFont: allow "Other..."

	menu of supported text encodings in "open text file" dialog, default autodetect
	sub-menu of supported text encodings on File menu, just like "file formats"

medic
	accept connection or switch to gdb:  should stop listening on port
		need simple example to submit to ACE list
	restart either xdebug or java:  unable to listen on port & crashes on exit
		also need to fix SetProgram()
	gdb
		enable call to UnlockDisplays(), when JXGetAssertHandler is defined
			check every time symbols are loaded

	for program with threads:
		set scheduler-locking on/off/step
		break <location> thread <gdb thread number>

	CMBreakpointTable:
		pressing return while editing the last row should save the value
		problem is that setting breakpoint value takes time, so can't restart editing immediately

	gdb test suite
		start, choose program, set bkpt, run
		start, run, open file, stop, set bkpt, continue
		start with program name, set bkpt, run
		start with core name
		switch from core dump to running binary
		switch from running binary to core dump
		switch from one program to another

systemg
	store alternate-open prefs for every executable in the directory
		use these prefs when plain-open is invoked
		when open prefs file for directory, flush non-existent executables

	trash must remember where each file came from
		~/.trash/.source stores list of original locations
		cull non-existent when re-write the file
		delete when empty trash

	optimize selection of multiple items via cmd line
		systemg code/*.cpp code/*.h
		rewrite MDI server to collect files in same directory
			then pass collection to SyGFindFileTask

memory analyzer
	jcc -- crash with deleted JMessageProtocol -- only when open project
	print table:  partial column on page 1

	option to print MDStatsDirector

		show info about query in window title

drakon
	filter input, like jcc file list

	re-nice dialog: slider
		if 0, default 19
		else, default 0

	SendSignal dialog

Clean up prefs
	JXPrefsDialog has tree list and card file
		tree list pane adjusts width to bounds of tree list
		card file pane sets min size to union of card sizes
	Split CBTextEditorPrefs into multiple panes
	factor out JXEditStylesWidget from JXEditStylesDialog so it can be a card

Docking
	MacOS: window placement inside dock sometimes wrong (iconfied windows)
	undock: window placement not restored
	raise window via menu shortcut:  dock moves on Ubuntu, and focus not set to the window

	When compartment minimized and move tab position, should readjust pane sizes
	When min page size increases in dock, adjust panes so divider visible
		(test:  move tab group tabs from side to top)

	Key shortcuts to move between dock compartments
		What key?  Tab is fully loaded in jcc
		cycle through leaf nodes of tree from left to right
		(first, build array of leaf nodes, then find current pane and switch to next)

JKeyHandler
	if we build key handlers for different file types:
		specify key handler in CharAction config
		JKeyHandlerStack extends JKeyHandler
			to combine different key handlers, can construct a stack
			if one returns kJFalse, the next one gets it

JXFontManager
	some characters extend above line height

JTextEditor::DrawInMargin
	line #'s
	bookmarks -- easier to see which line was marked
