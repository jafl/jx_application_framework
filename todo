	How to provide class-level info?
	explain section, module, block, etc

-----

jcc:
	load tasks directly from project file

split JTextEditor
	split off itsBuffer,itsStyles,itsUndo/RedoList into JTextBuffer
	split out reading HTML, unix man page (to jcc), etc.
	leave recalc engine, cursor location, and other display stuff in JTextEditor

	JTextEditor can be constructed from string or JTextBuffer

multi-pane editing
	CBTextDocument has handle to JTextBuffer
	use partitions to show multiple views
		double appropriate window dimension, if screen has space
	each partition needs small [x] to close
	small [+] buttons to split either horiz or vert

OSX window placement
	wmReshowOffset pushes window up instead of maintaining vertical position

	set breakpoint
		search code index <-> line index for location

xdebug
	click stack trace: selection jumps back to last frame
	temp breakpoint doesn't disappear

	Enable XDSocket::StartTimer() when not debugging
	Always update stack, even if Stack Trace window is hidden
	Eliminate double call to get local vars
		Preserve existing items; don't just delete all before update
	request source from debugger instead of assuming that file:// exists
	*set* values
	support conditional breakpoints, etc.

		https://code.google.com/p/easl/

	JString
		if input not valid UTF-8, convert from ISO8859-1 (configurable?)
		store character count separate from byte count
		static functions: utf8_strlen, utf8_prev(&i), utf8_next(&i)
		optimize GetCharacter(), etc - if not utf-8, use array index

	JRegex::defaultCFlags: add PCRE_UTF8

	convert one file at a time
		intermediate should be safe, except maybe confusion in JTextEditor/rendering
		JTextEditor needs to store glyph offset and byte offset

	for loops must use utf8_next/prev instead of i++/--

	UTF8_STRING for X selection
	use real X compose mechanism

leibnitz
	symbol font: transform to unicode and use X11 utf8 string width/drawing functions

-----

jcc
	implement *not* "one a a time" for commands -- svn remove, yui build
		when invoke one-at-a-time from not-one-at-a-time, invoke separate loop
		when invoke @ commands, must treat as one-at-a-time

	if modified separately in memory and on disk, offer to show diff
		if window closed, deactivate "Redo diff" button

	execute selected text by passing to interpreter running in command window
		perl/php -- executes only after closing pipe, wrap php in <? ... ?> if not already there
		python/ruby -- write to pipe after invoking, to allow inspecting result

	pref to turn off making mixed whitespace visible when indentation is mixed

	vi emulator
		dd doesn't work on last line of file
		Ndd doesn't include last line of file even if it should be included

	CBProjectTable AddDirectoryTree & AddFiles:
		treelist should stop listening to tree until done adding

medic
	accept connection or switch to gdb:  should stop listening on port
		need simple example to submit to ACE list
	restart either xdebug or java:  unable to listen on port & crashes on exit
		also need to fix SetProgram()
	gdb
		enable call to UnlockDisplays(), when JXGetAssertHandler is defined
			check every time symbols are loaded

	for program with threads:
		set scheduler-locking on/off/step
		break <location> thread <gdb thread number>

	CMBreakpointTable:
		pressing return while editing the last row should save the value
		problem is that setting breakpoint value takes time, so can't restart editing immediately

	gdb test suite
		start, choose program, set bkpt, run
		start, run, open file, stop, set bkpt, continue
		start with program name, set bkpt, run
		start with core name
		switch from core dump to running binary
		switch from running binary to core dump
		switch from one program to another

ASIO
	http://think-async.com/Asio - lightweight networking library
	JXApplication should call io_service::poll_one()
	requires exceptions - only worth switching when ACE no longer works without

OSX window placement
	modal windows, e.g., File Chooser, still migrate upward
	System G windows in dirs with no prefs open downward
	jcc man page window and "find file" result window appear under active window

Docking
	OSX: window placement inside dock sometimes wrong (iconfied windows)
	undock: window placement not restored
	raise window via menu shortcut:  dock moves on Ubuntu, and focus not set to the window

	When compartment minimized and move tab position, should readjust pane sizes
	When min page size increases in dock, adjust panes so divider visible
		(test:  move tab group tabs from side to top)

vi emulator
	dw      delete to end of word
	db      delete to beginning of word
	yw - yank to end of word
	yb - yank to beginning of word

	w	beginning of next word; 5w moves to the beginning of the 5th word to the right
	e	end of next word
	b	beginning of previous word

	cc	change line -- delete line and start insert mode
	s	change character -- delete character and start insert mode

	md d'd  mark starting line, cut to ending line
	my y'y  mark starting line, copy to ending line

Clean up prefs
	JXPrefsDialog has tree list and card file
		tree list pane adjusts width to bounds of tree list
		card file pane sets min size to union of card sizes
	Split CBTextEditorPrefs into multiple panes
	factor out JXEditStylesWidget from JXEditStylesDialog so it can be a card

JKeyHandler

	search results:  option to show n lines above and below matching line

	Pick a default size and location for text windows when first run
		based on desktop size (if not auto-dock all)

	multi-project
		open all .jcc files and display in one tree
			.jmp file stores list of .jcc files (relative or home or absolute paths)

	Tooltip-like window when open function arg list
		bold current argument, based on number of commas after opening paren
	Tooltip for scrolltabs: which function it is in

	PHP styler:
		falls out of PHP mode when it sees ?>
		while editing string, it may find ?> that should be inside string

	perl:  = 2 ?
		Delete 2, type 2 => styles are wrong to next ?
		Same with /, because both are regex constructs
		Need to restyle further?

	When search for something in CVS output window, doesn't hilight selection
	until wheel-mouse scroll.

	When cvs diff is run in directory with .jcc file, loses data from middle of
	.jcc contents to some later point -- only seen on work machine, and only
	with old single, line format

	CBTreeDirector:
		ReceiveWithFeedback:  include src file for C++
	Editor for regex's so compiler support is not hard-coded
	Cascade option for undocked windows
	Option to search all files in current project
	Symbol list: print unique prefix for file names (like in Files window)
	PHP: balance <? ?>
	JXChooseMonoFont: allow "Other..."

	Class trees need to search symbol database for function location.

	takes a long time to figure out that a 251MB file is large enough to
	warn about -- is the underlying code somehow reading the file to figure out
	how big it is?

memory analyzer
	option to print MDStatsDirector
	records window:

		start with JXButton
	jXGlobals loads all ddls in theme directory that start with theme ID
